<h2 id="lesson-1-a-puma-at-large-逃遁的美洲狮">Lesson 1 A puma at large 逃遁的美洲狮</h2>
<p>Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw &lsquo;a large cat&rsquo; only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed （confirmed跟了一个宾语从句）that a puma will （宾语从句这里用will 因为这句话是一个客观事实）not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved （prove是系动词 ）difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of &ldquo;cat-like noises&rsquo; at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been （ must have been 不是虚拟语气 表示推测）in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.</p>

<p>1 at large是介词短语，此处表示“逍遥自在”、“行动自由”的意思。
2 When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, 当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里的地方发现一头野生美洲狮时。这个从句中以that引导的从句是reports的同位语，用于进一步说明报告的内容。</p>
<p>However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>as the evidence began to accumulate,</p>
<p>, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>这两句都是状语从句， claimed to have seen 不定式 to haven seen动作的发生比claimed 要早</p>
<p>在英语中，<strong>&ldquo;forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong> 这种表达方式中不需要加介词。这是因为“south of London”已经是一个方位短语，表示“在伦敦以南”的位置。“forty-five miles”则进一步修饰了这个方位，表示具体的距离。</p>
<p>所以，整个短语 <strong>&ldquo;forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong> 可以直接理解为“距离伦敦南方45英里处”，不需要额外的介词。</p>
<p>不过，如果你用介词，也可以，比如：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;at a location forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong><br>
但这会使表达更冗长，通常不这样说。直接使用“forty-five miles south of London”更简洁和自然。</li>
</ul>
<p>这种结构在英语中很常见，例如：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;ten kilometers east of the city&rdquo;</strong> （在城市以东十公里处）</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;three blocks north of the station&rdquo;</strong> （在车站以北三个街区处）</li>
</ul>
<p>3 feel obliged to do sth. 是“感到不得不做某事”的意思。
4 it left behind it a trail of, 它身后留下一串……。 句末重心原则 原句应该是 left a trail ofxxx   behind it          svoo  宾语补语  behind it作<strong>补语</strong> a trail ofxxx is behind it
5 puma fur was found clinging to bushes中，clinging是现在分词， clinging to bushes此处作主语puma fur的主语补足语。下文中As no pumas had been reported missing…一句中，missing也是现在分词作主语补足语。</p>
<p>saw the puma up a tree.  up a tree. 是  puma  的补语</p>
<p>The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from</p>
<p>that the animal was a puma, 可以看做是状语从句  where had it come from，had是were now fully convinced过去的过去</p>
<p>6 in the possession of, 为……所有。</p>
<p>manage to do 表示成功地完成某件较为困难或具有挑战性的事情。这个短语通常用于强调某人克服了困难或障碍，最终达成了目标。</p>

<p>美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。</p>
<p>pumas are large,cat-like animasl.which are found in america.when the report  came into london zoo that a puma had been spotted froty-five miles  south of london.  these reports were not taken seriously. howerver,as the  evidence began to accumlate,.the expert  from zoo felt obliged to investigate,for the discription given  by people who claimed to have seeen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p><strong>搜寻</strong>美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时的看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它<strong>走</strong>哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿及死兔子之类的小动物，在许多地方看见爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮<strong>毛</strong>。有人抱怨说夜里听见“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏豢养的，不知怎么<strong>设法</strong>逃出来了。搜寻工作<strong>进行</strong>了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人<strong>担心</strong>。</p>
<p>the hunt for pumas began in a small village  where a women picking blackberries saw a large cat  only 5 yards away from her.</p>
<p>when she saw it, it <strong>ran away</strong> immediately.  the experts confirmed that puma will not attack people unless it is corned.</p>
<p>in the fact, the searching proved difficult.</p>
<p>,for the puma  was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away  in the evening .</p>
<p>Wherever it went,，it left behind it a trail of dead deer and  small animal like rabbit  ,</p>

<p>Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed （to get enough money )(to have the church clock repaired状语). The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.</p>
<p>One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o&rsquo;clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever are you doing up here Bill?&rsquo; asked the vicar in surprise.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to repair the bell,&rsquo; answered Bill. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.&rsquo;
&lsquo;You certainly did give me a surprise!&rsquo; said the vicar. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I&rsquo;m glad the bell is working again.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s the trouble, vicar,&rsquo; answered Bill. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s working all right, but I&rsquo;m afraid that at one o&rsquo;clock it will strike thirteen times and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.&rdquo;

<h2 id="lesson-3-an-unknown-goddess-无名女神">Lesson 3 An unknown goddess 无名女神</h2>
<p>Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys high, were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.</p>
<p>The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess <strong>and had, at one time, been painted.</strong></p>
<p>The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find(amazed  原因状语) that the goddess turned out to be(the goddess主语补语） a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.</p>
<p>She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.</p>

<p>When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf&rsquo;s wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him &lsquo;Mr. Bloggs&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Alf&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>如今</strong>，<strong>从事</strong>体力劳动的人的收入<strong>一般</strong>要比坐办公室的人高出许多。坐办公室的之所以<strong>常常</strong>被称作“白领工人”，就是<strong>因为</strong>他们通常是穿着硬领白<strong>衬衫</strong>，系着领带去上班。许多人常常情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的<strong>殊荣</strong>，<strong>此乃人之常情</strong>。而这常常会<strong>引起种种奇怪的现象</strong>，在埃尔斯米尔公司当清洁工的艾尔弗雷德.布洛斯就<strong>是一个例子</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>These days</strong>， people who do manual work   often receive far more mony than people who work in offices。</p>
<p>People who work in offices <strong>are frequently referred to as</strong> ‘White collar’  for the simple</p>
<p>reason  that     the usually wear a collar and tie  to go to work.  <strong>Such is human nature</strong> , that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the  <strong>privilege</strong>    of  becoming white colla workers.</p>
<p>this can give rise to <strong>curious situations</strong>，as it did  <strong>in the case of</strong>  Alfred Bloggers who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere   coperate。</p>
<p>艾尔弗结婚时，感到非常难为情，而没有将自己的职业告诉妻子。他<strong>只</strong>说<strong>在</strong>埃尔斯米尔公司<strong>上班</strong>。每天早晨，他穿上一身漂亮的黑色西装离家上班，<strong>然后</strong>换上工作服，当8个小时清洁工。晚上回家前，他洗个淋浴，<strong>重新 **   <strong>换上</strong>那身黑色西服。两年多以来，艾尔弗一直这样，他的同事也为他保守秘密。艾尔弗的妻子一直不知道她嫁给了一个清洁工，而且她永远也不会知道了，因为艾尔弗已找到薪职，不久就要坐办公室里工作了。他将来挣的钱只有他现在的一半。不过他觉得，地位升高了，损失点儿钱也值得。<strong>从此</strong>，艾尔弗可以</strong>一天到晚**穿西服了。<strong>别人</strong>将称呼他为“布洛格斯先生”，而不再叫他“艾尔弗”了。</p>
<p>When Alfred got married， he was to embarrassed to say anything to his wifte about his job。  He simply told that he worked for the coporation。 Every morning， he left home dressed in a smart black suit   .He <strong>then</strong> changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman .</p>
<p>Before he returing  home ,he took a shower and <strong>changed back into</strong> his suit.   Alfred did this for over two years, and his fellow kept his secret.  Alfred &rsquo;s wife has never discoverd that she married  a dustmen and she will never will.</p>
<p>For Alfred has just found another job ,he will soon be wokring in an office .</p>
<p>he will be earning only half （这里的half作名词）as much as he used to, but the feels that he rise in status is well worth the loss of money.</p>
<p><strong>Form now on</strong> ,Alfred will wear a suit  <strong>all day</strong> and    <strong>others</strong> e will call him Mr Bloggers ,not Alfred.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-5-the-facts-确切数字">Lesson 5 The facts 确切数字</h2>
<p>Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president&rsquo;s palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: ‘Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president&rsquo;s palace. ’The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing（现在分词作后置定语） him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.</p>
<p>The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would(使用 &ldquo;would soon&rdquo; 是因为主句使用了过去时态) soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet（<strong>yet</strong>作副词，adv. 又） another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o&rsquo;clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.</p>
<p>The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller&rsquo;s. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.</p>

<p>Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn&rsquo;t despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!</p>
<p>A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing ￡ 3, 000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé&rsquo;s wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. ‘So long as there&rsquo;s something to identify, we will give people their money back, ’said a spokeswoman for the Bank. ‘Last year, we paid ￡ 1. 5m on 21, 000 claims. ’</p>

<p>The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2, 473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. <strong>Now that</strong> a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.</p>
<p>During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to-30°and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard&rsquo;s monastery.</p>

<p>As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special <strong>enclosure</strong>.</p>
<p>In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different.</p>
<p>The temperature drops to  minus thirty degrees and <strong>very few</strong> people attempt to cross the Pass.</p>
<p>The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy.</p>
<p>The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to <strong>wander</strong> outside their enclosure.</p>
<p>The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter <strong>are parties of</strong> skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>These young people, who love the <strong>peace</strong> of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard&rsquo;s monastery.</p>

<p>How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights?</p>
<p>Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and <strong>affectionate</strong> towards humans, but they <strong>lead</strong> mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become <strong>submissive</strong> like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect <strong>feline</strong> independence. Most cats remain <strong>suspicious</strong> of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is <strong>a good deal of</strong> truth in this idea. A cat&rsquo;s ability to survive falls is based on fact.</p>
<p>Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, <strong>yet</strong> only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is <strong>no shortage of</strong> tall buildings. There are plenty of <strong>high-rise</strong> <strong>windowsills</strong> to fall, from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 <strong>storeys</strong>, yet only <strong>suffered from</strong> a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained <strong>paratroopers</strong>, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they <strong>are likely to</strong> injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.</p>

<p>1 Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. 在这句话中有一个否定词 never和一个含有否定意义的动词 fail，这两个否定词就组成了双重否定，而双重否定往往用来表示肯定。这句话可以译成：“猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。”
2 be based on，在……基础之上。
3 have in common，有共同之处。
4 the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。“the +形容词或副词比较级…the +形容词或副词比较级”的结构常用来表示比较关系，往往可以译成“越……越……”。 be likely to是“很可能会”的意思。</p>
<p><strong>参考译文</strong></p>
<p>猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。它们可以<strong>对人</strong>友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。它们从不<strong>像</strong>狗和马一样变得那么顺从。<strong>结果是</strong>人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。<strong>在它们的一生中</strong>，大多数猫都<strong>对</strong>人存有戒心。最使我们<strong>感兴趣</strong>的一件事情就是一种<strong>通俗的信念</strong>——猫有九条命。显然，这种<strong>说法</strong>里面包含着许多真实性。猫在跌落时能够<strong>大难不死</strong>是有事实作为依据的。</p>

<p>What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?</p>
<p>The great ship, Titanic, <strong>sailed for</strong> New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1, 316 passengers and a crew of 891.

Even if two of these were <strong>flooded</strong>, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great <strong>liner</strong> will always be remembered, for she went down on her first <strong>voyage</strong> with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Four days after <strong>setting out</strong>, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned <strong>sharply</strong> to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, <strong>narrowly</strong> missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a <strong>slight</strong> <strong>trembling</strong> sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so <strong>faint</strong> that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his <strong>horror</strong> that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people <strong>plunged</strong> into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1, 500 lives were lost.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-11-not-guilty-无罪">Lesson 11 Not guilty 无罪</h2>
<p>What was the Customs Officer looking for?</p>
<p>Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.</p>
<p>‘Have you anything to declare? ’ he asked, looking me in the eye.
‘No, ’ I answered confidently.
‘Would you mind unlocking （mind 后面一般加动名词）this suitcase please? ’
‘Not at all, ’ I answered.</p>
<p>The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer&rsquo;s face light, up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.</p>
<p>‘Perfume, eh? ’ he asked sarcastically. ‘You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty. ’
‘But it isn&rsquo;t perfume, ’ I said. ‘It&rsquo;s hair gel. ’ Then I added with a smile, ‘It&rsquo;s a strange mixture I make myself. ’
As I expected, he did not believe me.
‘Try it!’I said encouragingly.</p>
<p>The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-12-life-on-a-desert-island-荒岛生活">Lesson 12 Life on a desert island 荒岛生活</h2>
<p>What was exceptional about the two men&rsquo;s stay on the desert island?</p>
<p>Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. <strong>The other side of the picture is quite the opposite</strong>. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.</p>
<p>Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. Theycaught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it ‘ate like kings’. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.</p>

3 starve to death，饿死。
4 …wished they had stayed there longer.
……还真希望在那里多呆些日子。wish引起的宾语从句常用虚拟语气。
5 as one of them put it，正如其中一位所说的。<strong>Put</strong>: 在这个上下文中，表示 &ldquo;说&rdquo; 或 &ldquo;表达&rdquo; 的意思。</p>

<p>我们许多人对于荒岛生活<strong>有</strong>一种不切实际的想法。我们有时想像荒岛是阳光终日普照的天堂。在那里，生活简单又美好。成熟的水果从树上掉下来，人们根本无需劳动。<strong>另一种想法恰恰相反</strong>，认为荒岛生活很可怕，要么饿死，要么像鲁滨孙那样，天天盼船来，却总不见船影。也许，<strong>这两种想像都有可信之处</strong>。但很少有人能有机会去弄个究竟。</p>
<p>Most of us  have <strong>formed</strong>  an unrealistic  picture of life on a desert island。 we sometimes imagine  the island to be a sort of （有点，） paradise where the  sun always shines。   life  there is simple and good。Ripe fruit  falls from the trees and  people never have to work, <strong>the other side  of picture  is on the opposite</strong> .Life on a desert island is <strong>wretched</strong>.  You either starve to death or live like  Robinson Crusoe,</p>

<p>最近有两个人在一座珊瑚岛上<strong>呆</strong>了5天，他们真希望在那儿<strong>再多</strong><strong><strong>待</strong></strong>一些日子。他们<strong><strong>驾</strong></strong>着一条严重损坏的小船从维尔京群岛去迈阿密修理。<strong>途中</strong>，船开始下沉，他们迅速把食物、火柴、罐装啤酒往一只救生筏上<strong>装</strong>。然后在加勒比海上划行了几英里，到了一座珊瑚岛上。</p>
<p>岛上几乎没有一棵树，也没有淡水，但这不算什么问题。他们用橡皮艇<strong>蓄积</strong>雨水。<strong>由于</strong>他们随身<strong>带</strong>了一支捕鱼枪，因此，吃饭不愁。他们天天捕捉龙虾和鱼，正如其中一位所<strong>说</strong>，吃得“像国王一样好”。5天后，一条油轮从那儿<strong>路过</strong>，搭救了他们。这二位不得不离开那个荒岛时，还真的感到<strong>遗憾</strong>呢！</p>
<p>Recently two men  who spent five days on a coral island wished they had  stayed longer. they were taking a  badly damaged boat from    Virgin Islands to  Miami to  have it repaired,  <strong>During the journey</strong>, the boat began to sink,  they rapidly <strong>loaded</strong>  a  small rubber dinghy  with the food ,matches, and cans of beer  and <strong>rowed</strong> for a few miles  acrossed the Caribbean util they arrived  at coral island。</p>
<p>they <strong>were hardly  any trees</strong>  on the island and there was no water。<strong>but this didnt prove to be a problem</strong>。 they  collected  rainwater in the  rubber dinghy  。**As **they had brought a spear gun with them ,    they had plenty to eat. the caught lobster and fish every day. **as one of them   put it ** &lsquo;ate like kings&rsquo;,</p>

<p>After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, <strong>for in the evening she would be going to</strong> a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table.

<p>How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?</p>

<p>He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.</p>

<p>Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.</p>
<p>In times of peace, when business was bad,</p>

2 go a long way, 可以维持很久。
3 If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, 如果50便士的分币没有用来换糖果的话。exchange…for…作“以……换……”讲，注意英语中的便士有两种复数形式pence和pennies, 但用法不同。如：a fifty pence是指1个50便士的硬币，而fifty pennies是指50个1便士的硬币。
4 have found their way there, 其中there是指储蓄罐。find one&rsquo;s way在这里作“进入”讲，即放到“储蓄罐”里。
5 what is more, 更有甚者。是固定词组，此处用作插入语。</p>
<p>small gifts of money/ gifts of money 零花钱</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。爸爸妈妈<strong>当然</strong>经常<strong>给</strong>孩子零花钱，但是，叔舅婶姨也是孩子们额外收入来源。<strong>对于</strong>有些孩子来说，<strong>少量</strong>的钱可以花很长一段时间。如果50便士不拿来换糖吃，则可以放在<strong>储蓄罐里</strong>叮当响上好几月。但是能把储蓄罐<strong>装满</strong>的只有<strong>屈指可数</strong>的几个特别节俭的孩子。对大部分孩子来说，用50便士来买一大块好的巧克力，是算不了什么的。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-16-mary-had-a-little-lamb">Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb</h2>
<p>Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour? Why not?</p>
<p>Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.</p>
<p>One of Mary&rsquo;s prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.</p>
<p>She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening.</p>
<p>One evening, however the lamb was missing.</p>
<p>The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.</p>
<p>When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.</p>
<p>Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.</p>
<p>He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.</p>
<p>After telling several of his friends about the theft,</p>
<p>Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb.</p>
<p>Dimitri immediately went to Aleko&rsquo;s house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.</p>
<p>He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.</p>
<p>Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard.</p>
<p>It was true that he had just bought a lamb he explained,</p>
<p>but his lamb was black.</p>
<p>Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him.</p>
<p>While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko&rsquo;s house until the rain stopped.</p>
<p>When he went outside half an hour later,</p>
<p>he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white.</p>
<p>Its wool, which had been dyed black,</p>
<p>had been washed clean by the rain!</p>

Notes on the text课文注释</strong>
1 it would not prove difficult, 是不难做到的。
prove是连系动词，作“证明是”讲，本句子与it would not be difficult相同。
2 accuse sb. of (doing) sth. 作“指责、指控某人做某事”解。
3 he had better return it, 他最好把羔羊还给迪米特里。
had better用来表达一种建议，建议在将来某一具体场合采取的动作。这个短语比should和ought to的语气更强烈，常带有威胁、告诫或催促的意思。
4 denied taking it…,
deny后面可接动名词作宾语，也可接宾语从句。
5 apologize to sb. for (doing)sth. , 是“因（做）某事向某人道歉”的意思。</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>玛丽与丈夫迪米特里住在希腊南部一个叫波拉考拉的小村庄里。玛丽最珍贵的财产之一就是丈夫送给她的一只白色小羔羊。<strong>白天</strong>，玛丽把羔羊拴在地里的一颗树上，每天晚上把它牵回家。可是，一天晚上，那只小羔羊失踪了。绳子被人割断，很明显小羔羊是被人偷走了。</p>
<p>Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.</p>
<p>One of Mary&rsquo;s prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.</p>
<p>She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and <strong>went to</strong> fetch it every evening.</p>
<p>One evening, however the lamb was missing.</p>
<p>The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.</p>
<p>迪米特里从地里回来，妻子把情况跟他一说，他马上出去找偷羔羊的人。他知道在这样一个小村庄里抓住小偷并不困难。把失窃的事告诉几个朋友后，迪米特里发出他的邻居阿列科家突然<strong>多</strong>了一只小羔羊。迪米特里立刻去了阿列科家，气呼呼地指责他偷了羔羊，告诉他最好把羊交还，否则就去叫警察。阿列科不承认，并把迪米特里领进院子。<strong>不错</strong>，他的确刚买了一只羔羊，阿列科解释说，但他的羔羊是黑色的。迪米特里为自己的鲁莽而感到不好意思，向阿列科道了歉，说是错怪了他。就在他俩说话的时候，天下起了雨，迪米特里便呆在阿列科家里<strong>避雨</strong>，一直等到雨停为止。半小时后，当他从屋里出来时，他惊奇地发现小黑羔羊全身几乎都变成白色。原来羊毛上染的黑色被雨水冲掉了！</p>
<p>When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.</p>
<p>Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.</p>
<p>He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.</p>
<p>After telling several of his friends about the theft,Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly <strong>acquired</strong> a new lamb.</p>
<p>Dimitri immediately went to Aleko&rsquo;s house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.</p>
<p>He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.</p>
<p>Aleko denied taking it and <strong>led Dimitri into his backyard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It was true</strong> that he had just bought a lamb he explained,but his lamb was black.</p>
<p>Ashamed of <strong>having acted</strong> so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for <strong>having accused</strong> him.</p>
<p>While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko&rsquo;s house until the rain stopped.</p>
<p>When he went outside half an hour later,he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white.</p>
<p>Its wool, which had been dyed black,had been washed clean by the rain!</p>

<p>The longest suspension bridge in the world</p>
<p>How is the bridge supported?</p>
<p>Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known,sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.</p>
<p>He described it as &lsquo;a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal,for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.</p>
<p>The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island.</p>
<p>It has a span of 4, 260 feet.</p>
<p>The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth <strong>had to be taken into account</strong> by its designer.</p>
<p>Two great towers support four huge cables.</p>
<p>The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.</p>
<p>These alone took sixteen months to build.</p>
<p>Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.</p>
<p>They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.</p>
<p>Each of the four cables contains 26, 108 lengths of wire.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars,</p>
<p>it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity.</p>
<p>However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.</p>
<p>Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant,</p>
<p>fulfilling its designer&rsquo;s dream to creat &lsquo;an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible&rsquo;.</p>

<p>1524年，一位<strong>鲜为人知</strong>的意大利人维拉萨诺驾船驶进纽约港，并将该港名为安古拉姆。他对该港作了这样的描述：&ldquo;地理位置十分适宜，位于两座小山的中间，一条大河从中间流过&rdquo;。虽然维拉萨诺绝对<strong>算</strong>不上一个伟大的探险家，<strong>但他的名字将流芳百世</strong>，因为1964年11月21日建成的一座世界上最长的吊桥是以他的名字命名。</p>
<p>Verrazano, an Italian **about whom little is known,**sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.</p>
<p>He described it as &lsquo;a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.</p>
<p>（</p>
<p>In the midst of two small hills flowed a great river.
A great river flowed in the midst of two small hills.</p>

<p>Though Verrazano is by no means <strong>considered</strong> to be a great explorer, his name will probably <strong>remain</strong> <strong>immortal</strong>,for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.</p>
<p>维拉萨诺大桥由奥斯马.阿曼设计，<strong>连结</strong>着布鲁克林与斯塔顿岛，桥长4,260英尺。由于桥身太长，设计者不得不考虑了地表的形状。两座巨塔支撑着4根<strong>粗大</strong>的钢缆。塔身建在巨大的水下钢盘混凝土平台上。平台<strong>深入海底</strong>100英尺。仅这两座塔就花了16个月才建成。塔身 <strong>高</strong> 出水面将<strong>近</strong>700英尺。高塔支撑着钢缆，而钢缆又悬吊着大桥，4根钢缆中的每根由26，108股钢绳组成。据估计，若桥上<strong>摆满</strong>了汽车，也只不过是桥的总<strong>承载力</strong>的1/3。然而，这座桥重要特点不仅是它的规模与强度。尽管此桥很大，<strong>但它的结构简单</strong>，<strong>造型</strong>优美，实现了设计者企图创造一个&rdquo;<strong>尽量</strong>用细<strong>线</strong>条勾画出一个庞然大物&quot;的梦想。</p>

2 take no interest in…，作“对……不感兴趣”解。
3 cannot have failed to notice, 不至于没注意到。</p>
<p>“cannot+have+过去分词”表示对于过去的事所作的不肯定的推测。</p>

<p>4 move in response to a gust of wind，随风飘荡。
in response(to)作“回答’、“响应”、“作出反应”讲。此处是“（展品）随风而动”的意思。
5 be familiar to…是“为……所熟悉”的意思。
6 Lined up against the wall, 靠墙排列着。
7 like traffic lights which have gone mad, 就像失去控制的红绿灯一样。
go mad作“发疯”、“发狂”讲。
8 on and off（亦作 off and on）作“断断续续地”、“有时”讲。
9 These peculiar forms not only seemed designed…，其中seemed是系动词，seemed designed 作用与were designed是一样的。</p>
<p>familiar to 和 familiar with 是两个相近的词组，都有“熟悉”的意思，但是他们用法却有很大的不同，今天我们一起来学习一下。</p>
<p>\1. familiar to：这个词组的意思是“（某事物）对（某人）来说是熟悉的”。主语一般是事物，to 后一般接人。</p>

<p>Why was Rastus &lsquo;very dear&rsquo; in more ways than one?</p>
<p>Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals,but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay&rsquo;s cat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady,has shared a flat with her cat, Rastus, for a great many years.</p>
<p>Rastus leads an orderly life.</p>
<p>He usually takes a short walk in the evenings and is always home by seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>One evening, however he failed to arrive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ramsay got very worried.</p>
<p>She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.</p>
<p>Three days after Rastus&rsquo; disappearance,</p>
<p>Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter.</p>
<p>The writer stated that Rastus was <strong>in safe hands</strong> and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of $1,000.</p>
<p>Mrs.Ramsay was instructed to place the money in a cardboard box and to leave it outside her door.</p>
<p>At first, she decided to go to the police,</p>
<p>but fearing that she would never see Rastus again&ndash;the letter had made that quite clear&ndash;she changed her mind.</p>
<p>She <strong>withdrew</strong> $1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs.Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Rastus arrived <strong>punctually</strong> at seven o&rsquo;clock that evening.</p>
<p>He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty,for he drank half a bottle of milk.</p>
<p>The police were <strong>astounded</strong> when Mrs. Ramsay told them what she had done.</p>
<p>She explained that Rastus was very dear to her.</p>
<p>Considering the amount she paid,he was dear in more ways than one!</p>

<p>Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady,has shared a flat with her cat, Rastus, for a great many years.</p>
<p>Rastus leads an orderly life.</p>
<p>He usually takes a short walk in the evenings and is always home by seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>One evening, however he failed to arrive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ramsay got very worried.</p>
<p>She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>拉斯特斯失踪3天后，拉姆齐太太收到一封匿名信。写信人声称拉斯特斯安然无恙，只要拉姆齐太太愿意支付1,000 英镑赎金，可以立即将猫送还。他让拉姆齐太太把钱<strong>放</strong>在一个纸盒里，然后将纸盒放在门口。一开始拉姆齐太太打算报告警察，但又害怕再也见不到拉斯特斯&ndash;这点，信上说得十分明白&ndash;于是便改变了主意。她从银行取出1,000 英镑，并照绑架者的要求做了。第二天早晨，放钱的盒子不见了。但拉姆齐太太确信绑架者是会履行诺言的。果然，当天晚上7点正，拉斯特斯准时回来了。它看上去一切正常，只是口渴得很，喝了半瓶牛奶。拉姆齐太太把她所做的事告诉了警察，警察听后大为吃惊。拉姆齐太太解释说她<strong>心疼</strong>她的猫拉斯特斯。想到她所花的<strong>那笔钱</strong>，她的<strong>心疼</strong>就具有双重意义了。</p>
<p>Three days after Rastus&rsquo; disappearance，  Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter。</p>
<p>The writer stated that Rastus was in safe hands and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of $1,000.</p>
<p>Mrs.Ramsay was instructed <strong>to place</strong> the money in a cardboard box and <strong>to leave it</strong> outside her door.</p>
<p>At first, she decided to go to the police,but fearing that she would never see Rastus again&ndash;the letter had made that quite clear&ndash;she changed her mind.（破折号可以用来插入整个句子，作为对主要句子内容的补充、解释或强调。这种插入句通常会打断原来的句子结构，但提供了额外的重要信息）</p>
<p>She withdrew $1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs.Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Rastus arrived punctually at seven o&rsquo;clock <strong>that evening.</strong></p>
<p>He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty,for he drank <strong>half a bottle of</strong> milk.</p>
<p>The police were astounded when Mrs. Ramsay told them what she had done.</p>
<p>She explained that Rastus was very dear to her.</p>
<p>Considering the amount she paid,he was dear <strong>in more ways than one</strong>!</p>

两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。因此，他们被称作“职业拳击手”。不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。
拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他作出了重大贡献。是他把科学引进了这项运动。门多萨在的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他祟拜备至。</p>

<p>门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后一举成名。这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。事实上，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他反目为敌。两个人争吵不休，显而易见，只有较量一番才能解决问题。于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上较量，门多萨又输了一场。直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。他在被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。他因无力还债而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。</p>

<p>Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the gaoler?</p>
<p>Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night.</p>
<p>One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter.</p>
<p>Yet this is not always the case.</p>
<p>A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.</p>
<p>In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.</p>
<p>Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,he always insisted that it should be written out in full.</p>
<p>One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if,</p>
<p>after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.</p>
<p>The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.</p>
<p>Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.</p>
<p>He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat.</p>
<p>But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.</p>
<p>It was simply a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The gaoler <strong>looked on</strong> eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.</p>
<p>The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>squinting</strong> his eyes, he said: &lsquo;The light is <strong>dim</strong>. Read the letter to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.</p>
<p>Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,</p>
<p>the gaoler replied: &lsquo;The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. '</p>
<p>With this, he hurried off the stage.</p>
<p>Much to the aristocrat&rsquo;s amusement,the gaoler returned a few moments later</p>

<p>What was it about snails that made the writer collect them for his friend on that day in particular?</p>
<p>People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.</p>
<p>If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.</p>
<p>No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail.</p>
<p>Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>There are countless people who,ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food.</p>

<p>As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.</p>

<p>The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower,</p>
<p>I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.</p>
<p>Acting on a sudden impulse,I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.</p>

<p>在决定什么能吃而什么不能吃的时候，人们往往变得不合情理。比如，如果你住在地中海地区，你会把章鱼视作是美味佳肴，同时不能理解为什么有人一见章鱼就恶心。另一方面，你<strong>一想到</strong>动物油炸土豆就会反胃，但这在北方许多国家却是一种普通的烹任方法。<strong>不无遗憾的是，</strong> 我们中的大部分人，<strong>生来</strong>就只吃某几种食品，而且一辈子都这样。</p>

<p>参考译文</p>
<p>在小说中，我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家庭，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密。英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况。惊人的秘密称作“柜中骷髅”。在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地。当读者到小说<strong>最后几页</strong>了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.</p>
<p>The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.</p>
<p>The terrible secret is called &lsquo;a skeleton in the cupboard&rsquo;.</p>

<p>husbands.</p>
<p>这种事发生在小说中<strong>是无可非议的</strong>。尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密。连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道， 但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅。我所认识的唯一的在柜中<strong>藏</strong>骷嵝的人便是乔治.卡尔顿，他甚至引以为自豪。乔治年轻时<strong>学过医</strong>，然而，他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家。<strong>有一次</strong>，我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记。乔治把我<strong>领</strong>进客房，说这间很少使用。他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭。我将<strong>衬衫</strong>、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把<strong>随身带来的</strong>两套西服中的一套挂到大<strong>衣柜</strong>里去。我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下惊呆了。一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的。我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。这是比“骇人听闻的秘密”更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！但乔治却无动于衷。“噢，是它呀！<strong>他笑着说道</strong>，俨然在谈论一位老朋友。“那是塞巴斯蒂安。你忘了我以前是学医的了。”</p>

<p>What piece of bad luck prevented the Cutty Sark from winning the race?</p>
<p>One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.</p>
<p>She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.</p>
<p>She <strong>serves as an impressive reminder</strong> of the great ships of the past.</p>
<p>Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.</p>
<p>The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.</p>
<p>This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.</p>
<p>It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,</p>
<p>but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.</p>
<p>It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home,but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.</p>
<p>In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.</p>
<p>A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly,</p>
<p>this rudder would be torn away as well.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.</p>
<p>After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,</p>
<p>but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.</p>
<p>Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.</p>
<p>She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.</p>

1 Cutty Sark，“卡蒂萨克”号，19世纪一艘著名的帆船。现在这艘船在伦敦格林威治作为展品被保护了起来。在轮船时代以前，它是那时侯最快的帆船。
2 both these ships，这两艘船。
也可写成 both of these ships或 both ships。
3 The first of the two ships to reach Java…，两艘船中首先到达爪哇的……。不定式短语 to reach Java此处作定语，修饰 first，中间被另一个修饰 first的介词短语 of the two ships所分开。
4 take the lead，领先。
lose one&rsquo;s lead，失去其领先地位。
5 There is no doubt that if she <strong>had not lost</strong> her rudder she <strong>would have won</strong> the race easily. 毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵，“卡蒂萨克”号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。这是一个<strong>虚拟语气</strong>的句子，是对过去的一种假设。</p>

<p>人们在格林威治仍可看到19世纪最有名的帆船之一&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号。它<strong>停</strong>在陆地上，每年接待成千上万的参观者。它给人们留下深刻的印象，使人们回忆起历史上的巨型帆船。在蒸汽船取代帆船之前，&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号<strong>之类的</strong>帆船被用来从中国运回茶叶，从澳大利亚运回羊毛。&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号是帆船制造史上建造的最快的一艘帆船。唯一可以与之一比高低的是&quot;塞姆皮雷&quot;号帆船。两船于1872年6月18日同时从上海启航驶往英国，途中<strong>展开了</strong>一场激烈的比赛。这场比赛<strong>持续了</strong>整整4个月，是这类比赛中的最后一次，它<strong>标志</strong>着帆船伟大传统的结束与一个新纪元的开始。</p>
<p>比赛开始后，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&quot;号率先抵达爪哇岛。但在印度洋上，&ldquo;卡萨萨克&quot;号驶到了前面。看来，它首先返抵英国是确信无疑的了，但它却在比赛中连遭厄运。8月份&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号遭到一场特大风暴的袭击，失去了一只舵。船身左右摇晃，无法操纵。船员用备用的木板在船上赶制了一只应急用的舵，并克服重重困难将舵安装就位，这样一来，大大降低了船的航速。因为船不能开得太快，否则就有危险，应急舵也会被刮走。因为这个缘故，&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号落到了后面。跨越赤道后，船长将船停靠在一个港口，在那儿换了一只舵。但此时，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&quot;号早已在500多英里之遥了。尽管换装新舵时分秒必争，但&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号已经不可能取胜了，它抵达英国时比&quot;塞姆皮雷&quot;号晚了1个星期。但考虑到路上的多次耽搁，这个成绩也已很不容易了。毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵， &ldquo;卡帝萨克&quot;号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。</p>
