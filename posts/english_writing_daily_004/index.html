<h4 id="self-introduction">self-introduction</h4>
<p>Good morning/afternoon, it&rsquo;s great to be here. Thank you for the opportunity to this interview. I hope I can make a good performance today.</p>
<p>My Chinese name is XXX and you can call me XXX which is my English name .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m applying for a java development position today</p>
<p>I am 29 years old living in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I graduated from Shanghai Dian University in 2017 with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in software engineering. After i graduated, I started working as a Java Developer for 6 years</p>
<p>My last job was in B++ company. I worked in the technical department and i was  responsible for the development and maintenance of New Eye System,Starry Universe,and other systems.The New Eye System is an AI-based content review system that detects sensitive and risky content in videos, audios, images, and text.</p>
<p>The  New Eye System functions  consist of serveral parts.</p>
<p>Overall。The entire system is mainly an encapsulation of some AI model detection functions provided by algorithm colleagues.</p>
<p>整个系统主要是对算法同事提供的一些ai模型检测功能做的一个封装</p>
<p>My main work content is the implementation of authentication and authorization in the project and  various preprocessing steps and data extraction.</p>
<p>First, there will be a need for some configurations. For videos, frame rate frequency will be set, and for images, a blacklist of recognized individuals and detection of violent or terrorist-related weapons will be configured. For text content, sensitive word detection will be implemented. These configuration settings will be synchronized with the algorithm team. The algorithm team will use this data to generate AI models.</p>
<p>首先会需要进行一些配置。视频的话有切帧数频率，图片的话会配置人物黑名单，暴恐武器识别等。文本类的话会有敏感词检测。这些配置项会进行同步给算法组。算法组会根据这些数据生成ai模型。</p>
<p>Secondly, users will begin creating tasks by uploading videos. Different types of files will undergo various preprocessing steps. Video files in mp4 format will be converted to .m3u8 format and then sliced according to the configured frame rate. Text files will be processed based on the size of each page, and image files will be compressed.</p>
<p>第二部用户开始创建任务，上传视频，根据不同的文件类型进行不同的预处理，视频mp4文件转成.m3u8文件，按照配置的帧率切图。文本类的文件会根据每页多大进行处理，图片类的文件也会进行压缩。</p>
<p>Thirdly, the processing will be performed by calling the algorithm team&rsquo;s service (yolo8) through an HTTP interface. Upon successful processing, the algorithm team will callback our service&rsquo;s interface to save the data, clean the results, and perform statistical analysis. Ultimately, the results will be displayed to the users on a webpage.</p>
<p>第三部通过http接口调用算法组的服务（yolo8）进行处理，处理成功会回调我们服务的接口，进行保存，清洗数据，结果统计。最终在页面上给用户进行展示。</p>
<p>当时我们遇到有关地理数据计算的问题，当时在调研的过程中，我们使用了PostgreSql</p>
<p>At that time, we encountered problems related to geographic data calculation. During the research process, we used PostgreSql. For example, which communities appeared in a certain range?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I &rsquo;ve qualified in basic  English coummunication and i m familiar with programming</p>
<p>as you can see, l m motivated ,vibrant.as  a fast learner, and i have got the right attitude.</p>
<p>l m willing to work hard. to make sure that i can add value to your company</p>
<p>i  specifically applied to this job for English speaking environment .</p>
<p>i think everyone is struggling here to find a good job or to maintain the pay.</p>
<p>learning languages will always be the good choice.</p>
<p>you konw us dollar is the most popular currency in doing business in the world.</p>
<p>especially at the moment, you kown the economy is reviving and English is the most international business language</p>
<p>xxxx to keep me occupied for a while</p>
<p>My team consists of 4 backends engineers, 2 frontends engineers, 2 testers, 2 product managers</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s in computer-related industries, it is in my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>it is a rarity for me to have such English conversation.I think this is a valuable accumulation of experience</p>
<h4 id="what-kind-of-opportunities-are-you-looking-for-this-time">What kind of opportunities are you looking for this time?</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m Not Just Looking to Fill A Position,  I&rsquo;m Looking For A Career</p>
<p>I am looking for a long-term opportunity that I could excel</p>
<p>I Applied To This Position Because I Believe I Will Excel in this work environment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calm under pressure and interact well with othecs</p>
<p>From Your Website, It Looks Like The Environment Is Fast Paced And  Structured To Expand</p>
<p>And I Enjoy Working In An Environment Experiencing rapid growth.</p>
<p>And I Belleve This  Is The Ideal Work Environment for my working style.&quot;</p>
<p>The reasons for recent resignations from the two companies were layoffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am currently seeking a job opportunity that offers room for growth and stability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there are changes in the work content, I will also adapt to them.&quot;</p>
<p>For at least a year,preferably longer if I can grow with the company.</p>
<h4 id="what-kind-of--team-are-you-looking-for-this-time">What kind of  team are you looking for this time?</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to work in a team where mutual learning and collective growth are encouraged. Additionally, I aspire to have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making and planning processes of projects, leveraging my imagination and creativity to contribute to their success. In summary, I look forward to finding an opportunity that challenges and enhances my abilities, while allowing me to collaborate with an excellent team to achieve common goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>希望能够在一个能够相互学习和共同成长的团队中工作。此外，我也希望能够有机会参与项目的决策和规划过程，发挥自己的想象力和创造力，为项目的成功贡献力量。综上所述，我期待着找到一个能够挑战自己、提升自己，并且能够与优秀的团队共同努力实现目标的机会。&quot;</p>
<h4 id="career-planning">career planning</h4>
<p>I want to become a senior Java developer within a few years and be able to be responsible for projects independently. Of course, if there is any need at work, I can adapt to it.</p>
<h4 id="project-flow">Project Flow</h4>
<p>In general, the projects within the company typically involve one to two requirement meetings. After the requirements are confirmed, there will be some preliminary technical research. Following this, tasks and schedules are assigned to team members based on functional modules. If there are any difficulties, they can be raised and collectively resolved. Subsequently, interface APIs are defined, and mock data is generated, facilitating synchronous development with frontend colleagues. Finally, unit testing, functional testing, and other procedures are carried out.</p>
<p>一般情况下，公司内的项目需要一到两次的需求会议。需求确认结束后，会有一些前期的技术调研。之后的后按照功能模块进行任务人员的划分和排期。如果有难点可以提出，共同解决。之后的话定义接口api，mock数据。也能让前端同事同步地开发。之后需要单元测试，功能测试等等</p>
<h4 id="overtime">overtime</h4>
<p>When you encounter an emergency after geting off work, sometimes you need to solve the problem immediately</p>
<h4 id="habbit"><em>habbit</em></h4>
<p>Two weeks after I left, I did feel anxious and stressed</p>
<p>I frequently enjoy watching videos on bilibili, and I follow some content creators who speak English in their videos.</p>
<p>One of the creators I follow is 邵Alan, who specializes in producing amusing videos about communicating with foreigners in English on socialising platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m a follower of CoachGreg格教练, a fitness coach who uploads videos on bilibili specifically focused on domestic fitness topics. These videos differ from the content he shares on YouTube. I always appreciate his advice as it is consistently constructive and sincere.</p>
<p>我经常喜欢在哔哩哔哩上看视频，我关注一些在视频中说英语的内容创作者。</p>
<p>我关注的创作者之一是邵Alan，专门制作关于在网站上用英语与外国人交流的有趣视频。</p>
<p>此外，我还是教练Greg的追随者格教练, 一位在哔哩哔哩上传视频的健身教练，专门关注国内健身话题。这些视频与他在YouTube上分享的内容不同。我一直很感激他的建议，因为它始终是建设性的和真诚的。</p>
<p>I often watch videos on bilbli and i followed some uploader speaking English in videos.</p>
<p>I followed 邵Alan, who is a video contenet creater.  uploading funny videos about communicating with foreigners in English on websites.   .                                 I followed  CoachGreg格教练,who is  fitness Coach. uploading videos related to demostic  fitness on bilibilib.which is different from the videos he uploaded on youtube.His advice was always very constructive and sincere.</p>
<h3 id="what-challenges-did-you-encounter-in-the-project">What challenges did you encounter in the project?</h3>
<p>I was primarily responsible for the A system. In the beginning, the system&rsquo;s requirements were quite complex, involving numerous steps for each task.</p>
<p>break it down into smaller pecies</p>
<p>To coordinate the task flow steps, we employed Rocktmq, which allowed us to subdivide multiple tasks into various topics within the message queue (MQ):</p>
<ol>
<li>Decoupling the tasks resulted in clearer and more maintainable code.</li>
<li>It helped avoid interference between different steps. By executing a specific step that took a long time asynchronously, we prevented it from blocking other tasks, thus potentially increasing overall throughput.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I undertook several tasks to optimize the system&rsquo;s performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilizing ThreadPool to execute some tasks asynchronously.</li>
<li>Leveraging Redis to store Order transaction quantities instead of relying on MySQL for counting, thereby enhancing query performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>任务流程步骤通过rocktmq流转，mq 里 将这么多任务步骤细分这么多 topic 。</p>
<p>\1. 解耦，代码上更清晰容易维护
\2. 避免各步骤相互影响，如果其中某个步骤耗时比较长的话，会阻塞其他任务的执行，容易拉低整体的吞吐量</p>
<p>i was mainly  responsible for the  aaa system  .  in the beginning，the system‘s demand is complex. there are many steps each task。</p>
<p>The task flow steps will be coordinated using rocktmq. Multiple tasks will be subdivided into various topics within the message queue (mq):</p>
<ol>
<li>Decoupling the tasks will result in clearer and more maintainable code.</li>
<li>It will avoid interference between different steps. If a certain step takes a long time to execute, it could block other tasks and potentially reduce overall throughput.</li>
</ol>
<p>l also did some work  such as using threadpol to optimize some task performance <strong>asynchronously</strong>，using redis to store the Order transaction quantity instead of using mysql to count the quantityt  to optimize  query performance .</p>
<h2 id="lostark"><strong>Lostark</strong></h2>
<p>Today, I want to talk about the game I&rsquo;ve recently been playing, Lost Ark. Lost Ark has been open to the public for nearly a month and has gained popularity among MMORPG players. In my opinion, even though Lost Ark is a 2.5 angle-of-view game, its performance is top-level and epic, comparable to games like World of Warcraft (WoW). I can see elements from various games, such as God of War, Devil May Cry, Blade &amp; Soul, and Warcraft, but it combines them in a unique and exciting way.</p>
<p>今天，我想谈谈我最近在玩的游戏《失落的方舟》。《失落的方舟》已经开放近一个月了，在MMORPG玩家中受到了欢迎。 在我看来，《失落的方舟》虽然是一款2.5视角的游戏，但它的表现却是顶级的、史诗般的，可以与魔兽世界等游戏相媲美。 我可以看到各种游戏的元素，比如《战神》、《鬼泣》、《剑灵》和《魔兽争霸》，但它以一种独特而令人兴奋的方式将它们结合起来。</p>
<p>One notable aspect of Lost Ark is the sense of shock it delivers, which is also top-level. The game manages to captivate players who used to play Dungeon &amp; Fighter (DNF), and it has put pressure on DNF&rsquo;s planning, leading to improved event rewards.</p>
<p>《失落的方舟》的一个值得注意的方面是它所带来的震撼感，这也是顶级的。 该游戏成功吸引了曾经玩过《地下城与勇士》（DNF）的玩家，也给《地下城与勇士》的规划带来了压力，从而提高了活动奖励。</p>
<p>Overall, Lost Ark has proven to be a thrilling and engaging MMORPG, drawing in players from different backgrounds and delivering an exceptional gaming experience. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre.</p>
<p>总的来说，《失落的方舟》已被证明是一款惊心动魄、引人入胜的大型多人在线角色扮演游戏，吸引了来自不同背景的玩家，并提供了卓越的游戏体验。 我强烈推荐给任何喜欢这种类型的人。</p>
<p>totday， i want to talk about the game i recently play，lostark。 lostark has been open to public for nearly a month. it is popular among  players who like mmorpg. in my opion.  although lostark is a 2.5 agle of view game, the performance in the game is Top-level and epic. it can be mentioned in the same breath with wow.   and i see many games shadow in this game ,such as god of war ,devil may cry, blade soul. warcraft, but it combine with  the element good.</p>
<p>by the way,the sense of shock in this game is also Top-level.</p>
<p>and lostark  atracted players whro used to play dnf. and also  made the dungeon‘s’and fighter planning  feel pressured and Improved event rewards.</p>
<h2 id="summary-after-one-month-of-resignation"><strong>Summary after one month of resignation</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I have been job hunting for the past month and have yet received any suitable job offers. While I&rsquo;ve done well in some interviews, certain companies seem to have a hiring freeze with few opportunities for non-outsourced development. It&rsquo;s been almost a month and my mood has been fluctuating.</p>
<p>In addition, I was infected with the covid virus. While the second attack wasn&rsquo;t as severe, it did disrupt my daily life. I believe I was well prepared for the interview, but even with a good performance there may have been more competitive candidates involved.</p>
<p>After a month of job hunting, I found that the competition in the domestic software industry is very fierce now. Constantly improving my technical skills and maintaining a positive attitude is critical. I am lucky to have my own savings and no financial burdens.</p>
<p>At this point, my focus is to move on and find the right career opportunity.</p>
<p>不幸的是，过去一个月我一直在找工作，但没有收到任何合适的工作机会。 虽然我在一些面试中表现不错，但某些公司似乎冻结了招聘，几乎没有非外包开发的机会。 已经快一个月了，我的心情一直在波动。</p>
<p>另外，我还感染了新冠病毒。 虽然第二次袭击没有那么严重，但确实扰乱了我的日常生活。 我相信我为面试做好了充分的准备，但即使表现良好，也可能有更具竞争力的候选人参与其中。</p>
<p>经过一个月的求职，我发现国内软件行业的竞争非常激烈。 不断提高我的技术技能和保持积极的态度至关重要。 我很幸运，有自己的积蓄，没有经济负担。</p>
<p>此时，我的重点是继续前进并找到合适的职业机会。</p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-meaning-of-life"><strong>What &rsquo;s the meaning of life</strong></h2>
<p>After resigning, I find myself with more leisure time. During these moments, I often contemplate a question: <strong>If you were</strong> not obligated to work, what <strong>would</strong> you choose to do?</p>
<p>When we are <strong>engrossed in</strong> our jobs, it&rsquo;s often challenging to spare a thought for such matters, as our attention is primarily consumed by the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the <strong>essence of life</strong> extends beyond the <strong>realm of employment</strong>. Having grown up in an urban environment and scarcely ventured beyond its boundaries, my initial <strong>inclination leans toward</strong> exploring new horizons, particularly through travel. I frequently <strong>indulge in</strong> watching videos on platforms like Bilibili, where I follow certain content creators, such as bicycle travel bloggers. One of the creators I <strong>avidly</strong> track is Xuyun, an explorer who once roamed the landscapes of China on his bike, even though he has since retired from cycling.</p>
<p>These videos kindle within me the aspiration to break free from routine and witness the <strong>diverse tapestry of the world</strong>. Consequently, I&rsquo;ve taken up cycling myself in recent months, <strong>embarking on my own journeys</strong>. How about you? What ambitions have been sparked within you?</p>
<p>辞职后，我发现自己有了更多的闲暇时间。 在这些时候，我经常<strong>思考</strong>一个问题：如果你没有义务工作，你会选择做什么？</p>
<p>当我们<strong>全神贯注于</strong>工作时，通常很难花时间去思考这些事情，因为我们的注意力主要集中在手头的任务上。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，<strong>生活的本质 <strong>不只是</strong>就业的范围</strong>。 我在城市环境中长大，几乎没有冒险超越城市的界限，因此我最初的<strong>倾向</strong>倾向于探索新的视野，特别是通过旅行。 我经常<strong>沉迷于</strong>在哔哩哔哩等平台上观看视频，在这些平台上我关注某些内容创作者，例如自行车旅行博主。 我热切追踪的创作者之一是徐云，一位探险家，他曾经骑着自行车漫游中国的风景，尽管后来他已经不再骑自行车了。</p>
<p>这些视频激发了我摆脱常规、见证<strong>世界多样化的</strong>渴望。 因此，最近几个月我开始自己骑自行车，<strong>开始自己的旅程</strong>。 你呢？ 您内心激发了哪些野心？</p>
<p>After resignation,i have more leisure time .During this time , i  sometimes think a problem, if you don need to work, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>if we are working， we may have no time to think about the problem. We only focus on the job at hand.</p>
<p>Absolutely， the meaning of life isnt all about to job.   As a person who grew up in the city and has basically never been to other places ,the first thing I think of is travellign . i  frequently enjoy watching videos on bilibili, and I follow some content creators who is bike travel blogger.One of the creators I follow is xuyun wandering in china, who specializes in producing cycling tour video. although he no longer rides.</p>
<p>The videoes spark  me the idea of getting  out and see ther worlds ,i have started cycling in recent months.  and what &rsquo;s about yours?</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>I have been plagued by insomnia in the past few months, although it is not serious.</p>
<p>During my student days, I rarely suffered from insomnia. But after working for a few years, insomnia began to appear, including now when I’m looking for a job.z</p>
<p>I even tried taking syrup for insomnia, but it didn&rsquo;t work very well.In my opinion, the cause of insomnia basically boils down to anxiety.</p>
<p>If you spend a lot of time watching short videos on your phone every day and don&rsquo;t improve yourself according to the plan, you will end up feeling anxious.</p>
<p>For me, the solution to insomnia is to complete tasks as quickly as possible, and to go out for a walk to maintain physical and mental health.</p>
<p>what about you， haven you plagued by insomnia ？</p>
<p>I have experienced occasional insomnia over the past few months, although it hasn&rsquo;t reached a severe level.</p>
<p>Back in my student days, insomnia was a rarity for me. However, after several years of working, I began to grapple with bouts of insomnia, a challenge that persists even during my current job search.</p>
<p>I even experimented with insomnia relief syrups, but the results were far from satisfying. From my perspective, the root cause of my insomnia largely traces back to anxiety.</p>
<p>Spending extended periods watching short videos on my phone each day without corresponding self-improvement efforts has undoubtedly contributed to a sense of restlessness.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;ve found that the key to overcoming insomnia lies in efficiently accomplishing tasks and prioritizing brisk walks to uphold both physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>How about you? Have you ever experienced the torment of insomnia?</p>
<p>这几个月我偶尔会失眠，虽然还没有达到严重的程度。</p>
<p>在我的学生时代，失眠对我来说是很少见的。 然而，工作几年后，我开始与失眠作斗争，即使在我目前的求职过程中，这一挑战仍然存在。</p>
<p>我什至尝试过缓解失眠的糖浆，但结果远不能令人满意。 在我看来，我失眠的根本原因很大程度上可以追溯到焦虑。</p>
<p>每天长时间看手机短视频却没有相应的自我提升，无疑会产生一种不安的感觉。</p>
<p>对我来说，我发现克服失眠的关键在于有效地完成任务并优先快走以保持身心健康。</p>
<p>你呢？ 你经历过失眠的折磨吗？</p>

<h2 id="summary-after-two-month-of-resignation"><strong>Summary after two month of resignation</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I have been job hunting for two months and have yet received any suitable job offers. Two months at home went by really quickly.</p>
<p>This make me feel that it is really difficult to find a job now.</p>
<p>I have summarized the following reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is not a problem with the resume, because I have an interview with a non-outsourcing company every week.</p>
<p>Second, it may be because of the higher expected salary, but I am not sure.</p>
<p>Third, some senior Java development positions require familiarity with front-end development. I feel that I cannot achieve this and will not consider it in the short term. But my technical depth and breadth are indeed insufficient, otherwise I should be able to pass some interviews. The only thing I can do now is to improve my technical breadth and depth .</p>
<p>During this National Day holiday, without outside interruption, I should keep studying.</p>
<h2 id="self-discipline"><strong>self-discipline</strong></h2>
<p>Since I was a student, I have not persisted in many things. Generally speaking, I am a person with poor self-control. In the current stage of looking for a job at home, I have not always learned English  and development technics  according to my plan. In the past few years of working, I have not had the habit of continuing to learn technology.</p>
<p>从我学生时代起，我有很多事情都没有坚持下来.总的来说，我是个自制力不强的人.就拿在目前在家找工作的阶段中，我并没有始终按照自己的计划学习英语和java.在过去工作的几年中， 我也没有持续学习技术方面的习惯。</p>
<p>Just these days, I saw a comment that self-discipline is one desire suppressing another desire, starting from small things. If you can persist in self-discipline and study for a year, and have a good job in the next ten years, why not try it?</p>
<p>就在这几天，我看到了一个评论，自律就是一个欲望压制另一个欲望，从小事做起.假如能坚持自律学习一年，在未来的十年内拥有一份好的工作，为什么不尝试下？</p>

<h2 id="2what-s-the-meaning-of-life"><strong>2What &rsquo;s the meaning of life</strong></h2>
<p>Recently, I have been pondering over this issue again, especially in the past few months. I haven&rsquo;t encountered anything particularly joyful during this time, and unfortunately, the most regrettable event in my life has occurred. i finally learned that Life is a process of gradually becoming lonely</p>
<p>In this period of unemployment, there are times when I find it hard to control my feelings of sadness about these matters, even though some time has passed.</p>
<p>Firstly, I believe that for an ordinary person, the meaning of life should involve doing things they enjoy, such as hobbies, whether it be playing games or traveling. For example, playing the game &ldquo;Lost Ark&rdquo; brings me joy when defeating raid bosses, and participating in in-game events in &ldquo;League of Legends&rdquo; to obtain free skins also brings me happiness.</p>
<p>However, to achieve these goals, there must be financial support, especially if one hasn&rsquo;t reached financial independence. In such cases, ordinary individuals usually have to earn money through employment. As Simpson once said, &ldquo;Work sucks, that&rsquo;s why they pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Employment is just one way to earn money, and for someone like me, who is actively seeking employment in the software development field, continuous learning is essential to prolong one&rsquo;s career. Therefore, even with ample time at home, it&rsquo;s important to persist in learning and not become complacent.</p>
<p>最近，我又开始琢磨这个问题。最近几个月。我没有遇到什么特别开心的事情,甚至我人生中目前最遗憾的事情发生了。</p>
<p>在失业的这段时间里，我有时会控制不住对这些事情 感到悲伤，可惜，即使事情已经过去了几个月。我最终发现人生是一个逐渐变孤单的过程，但生活还需要继续，珍惜身边人.</p>
<p>首先，我想，对一个普通人，人活着的意义应该是做一些喜欢做的事情吧，就比如兴趣爱好，可以是玩游戏，旅游等。就比如我，在玩 失落的方舟这款游戏 打军团长的时候就挺快乐，在玩英雄联盟做游戏内活动白嫖到皮肤就挺快乐.我认为环游世界是人生的终极目标之一</p>
<p>但是生活需要面包，为了实现这些总得需要些经济方面的支持，如果你还没有到财务自由的地步。那么普通人一般就只能通过上班来赚钱.辛普森说过 work suck, that s why they paid。</p>
<p>上班只是赚钱的一种方式，而对正在找工作从业软件开发 也不会其他专业技能的我来说，需要持续的学习来延长职业寿命才能在竞争激烈的求职市场中找到合适的工作。在人生迷茫的时候，更需要建立目标。所以目前在家 时间还很多的情况下，还是要坚持学习，不能躺平。</p>
<h2 id="learn-english"><strong>learn English</strong></h2>
<p>may you pass every exam get every offer</p>
<p>may the youth be with you</p>
<p>it s been a long time since i made any english related videos， so today i m taking some time out  to talk to all of you about some insights on learning english</p>
<h3 id="first-question--how-to-learn-quickly">first question  how to learn quickly？</h3>
<p>a lot of folks in the comments of my previous videos or private messages keep asking me how to quickly learn english?</p>
<p>i know there are plenty of content creators out there with <strong>clickbait titles(点击诱饵标题)</strong>   making it seems like   they ve got some magic trick  to instantly becoming an english pro,</p>
<p>but here is the thing, my answer is that learning english quickly just aint gona happen , it s not that simple,my friend</p>
<p>english is a language ,it is not like any other subject you can cram for.</p>
<p>let s take a moment to think about how you learn chinese，could you crammed for a chinnese  language test of college entrance examination in your</p>
<p>early teens and **aced (顺利通过考试)**it.</p>
<p>i mean it s not completely impossible,but its pretty nonsense</p>
<p>learning english takes time and immersion,, you gotta be constantly exposed to and  using english   both in and   out of school  ,day in and day out</p>
<p>now ,those content creators you see  sure  they have some quicks tips to share and their english might be <strong>top notch(顶尖).</strong></p>
<p>but trust me ,there s a lot  they are not telling you)</p>
<p>take me for example, you might think that at 40 years old i must have some secret weapon  to  pass  the telts exam <strong>with flying color(<em>出色</em>地;）.</strong></p>
<p>here s the reality，Considering how busy the work is ,even if i squeeze  every spare  second  out of my day,there s not so much time left for studying, if it werent for my longstanding interest in english and never giving up  on it,passing the IELTS would be  <strong>down right  （彻底的）</strong> impossible.</p>
<p>so lets get real,the first role in learning english is to <strong>ditch(抛弃)</strong> those fantasies,facing the truth and plan for the long haul</p>
<h3 id="second-question-what-is-your-goal">second question, what is your goal?</h3>
<p>the goal of learning english can be divided into  two main types, the first type is all about exams.  if you need to pass a specific exam for school or work,then this is what you are aiming for</p>
<p>the other type is all about  proficiency ,if you want to genuinely imporove  you languages skills, whether its for  traveling and communicating aboard</p>
<p>enjoying foreign movies and literature or accessing  online information directly then this is your goal.</p>
<p>now earlier i mentioned that learning english  takes time and  can be washed however  if you  are focused on exams,there are defintely some shorcuts you can take, you see every exams has its own rules ,scope techniques and standards,  which  means there are strategies to quickly  <strong>boost your scores</strong>.</p>
<p>but heres the thing. your foundation plays a big role in hoe much you can improve.</p>
<p>for example if you are thinking of taking the ilets but you  are not  even at  a level of cet4,  i strongly suggest you reconsider, it s not going to</p>
<p>the problem with exam  <strong>oriented(adj .以…为方向的;)</strong> learning is that  once you ve  done with you exams, you tend  to forget everthing you learn, thats why many people who passed exams like cet4 or cet6  still struggle with spoken in enlglish</p>
<p>if your goal is truly enhance your english proficiency ,unfortunately  our english education system from  childhood to adulthood dosent really focus on that.</p>
<p>think about it, when we study chinese language, we <strong>delve into(钻研)</strong> various classic text from ancient to morden times, analyzing centrial ideas and <strong>rhetorical 修辞的</strong>  <strong>devices 手法</strong>, but in english  classes  wo dont really do that.</p>
<p>we mainly focus on everyday communication and common  life situation，that s the difference.   we see english as a tool, not a comprehensive language</p>
<p>proficiency. so what we learn is far from sufficient. we need to explore more learning methods. for instance，  you have <strong>decent（adj.相当的）</strong> readiing ability，you can starting  <strong>devouring</strong>（津有味地看） a wide range of  English materials to develop your language  <strong>intuition（n.直觉）</strong> along the way.</p>
<p>this pass may be long and challenging to stick with. but it definely bring you greater rewards.</p>
<h3 id="second-question-what-is-the-use-of-english">second question, what is the use of english?</h3>
<p>there are many people who think that learning english is not useful because it is not necessary in daily work and life. that might be true but it may not be true for you. for instance. my grandmather believe that learning to use mobile phone  is not useful because it dosent improve the quailty of life.</p>
<p>the need to learning english <strong>varies（vary v.有别）</strong> for  each  individual.  people who believed that English is <strong>pointless</strong> probably would nt  have a need for it  and people who need  to use english probably wouldnt ask the question</p>
<p>learning english is not suitable for everyone，and l wouldnt recommend everyone to take IELTs exam.  however  if  you are feeling unsure  i can tell you</p>
<p>that if you want to excel in sicence or enginering filed, learning english is definely necessary. you will need  to access a lot of  english resources,.write papers in english and possibly study aboard or participate in  an exchange program.</p>
<p><strong>moreover</strong>, a significant portion of the wealth of human civilization  whether  its in science or literature truly exists in the english speaking world.</p>
<p>with only a small portion being translated into chinese. having this ability means that a new world has opened up for you with more possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>by doing so</strong>,  you can not olny become more exceptional individual, but contribute to the modernization of our country  with your knowledge.</p>
<p>so why not give it a try</p>
<h3 id="last-question-dose-it-become-more-difficult-to-learn-english-as-you-get-older">last question, dose it become more difficult to learn english as you get older</h3>
<p>i mean  look at me  i m 40years old.</p>
<p>for all courses, language  may be the least related to age. why is it unrelated. because language is  really not that hard.</p>
<p>no matter how old you are or what you educational level is.  if you are thrown  into a foreign country for just 2 months without any contact with chinese people. your english level will definitely improve quickly.</p>
<p>the learning curve for most subject like a curve.  as you learn to a certaion point, understanding become harder.</p>
<p>as you get older ,you ability to understand may decline.  however  the learing curve  for language is straighforward.</p>
<p>as long as you put into time. you ll definitely make  <strong>corresponding</strong> improvements.  sometimes  ,l see learning english as a  game like leveling up by defeating monsters. even though  the process can be boring,  i know that  as long as i invest  enough time  and click the mouse enough times,  i definitely</p>
<p>level up  <strong>accordingly（因此 adv）</strong>.</p>
<p>in fact when we usually say that  sth is  difficult  beacuse of age，  what we actually  think is that  we have less time when we older  and we  have to balance  work  and family  rather than  the thing itself becoming  harder.  but  you think about it from a different perspective，Would life be a waste, if you give up because of  those reasons.  if you can spend less time  playing games，watching dramas  and learn sth to expand you horzions  and increase your possibilitires.  wouldnt that be better.</p>
<p>so after work and daily life，I suggest you do some daily tasks，defeat some monsters  and  gain some experience for youself. of course， you dont have to specifically  learn english， you can also  run，exercise， make videos etc。 as long as you keep going，you ll  see changes.  the principles are the same.</p>
<p>if my video can  make you start thinking and not be stuck aimlessly       in the **trivialities(n.琐事) **or daily work and life. then  i think that s the true meaning of this video.</p>
<p>When you insist on doing something, you will always encounter times when you can&rsquo;t persist. But if you give up a lot of things, will your life become a pity?</p>

<p>chatgpt 说的</p>
<p>失去朋友是非常痛苦的经历，而每个人在处理哀伤时都有自己的节奏和方式。即使已经过了半年多，你的感受是完全正常的。哀伤没有固定的时间线，有时候你会发现某些日子或事件会唤起强烈的情感，甚至让你感到回到原点。</p>
<p>在面对这种悲伤时，记住以下几点可能会有所帮助：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>允许自己感受</strong>：悲伤是一种自然的情感反应，允许自己感受这份痛苦。压抑情感可能会延长治愈的过程。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>与他人分享</strong>：和朋友或家人谈谈你的感受，或者加入哀伤支持小组，与有类似经历的人交流。这可以帮助你感到不那么孤独。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>照顾自己</strong>：确保你在身体和精神上照顾好自己，保持健康的饮食、适量的运动和充足的休息。压力可能会加剧悲伤，所以照顾自己是关键。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>纪念和纪念</strong>：以一种特别的方式纪念你的朋友，无论是通过写日记、制作纪念品，还是参加一些特别的活动，这可以帮助你保持与他们的联系。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>寻求专业帮助</strong>：如果你发现悲伤严重影响了你的日常生活，不要犹豫，寻求心理医生或哀伤辅导的帮助。他们可以提供专业的支持和策略，帮助你处理悲伤。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>记住，哀伤是一个旅程，没有固定的终点。每个阶段都有自己的挑战，但也有机会逐渐找到平静和接受。希望这些建议能对你有所帮助，并且你能在这个过程中找到一些安慰和支持。</p>
<p>余华说过，亲人的离去不是一场暴雨,而是此生漫长的潮湿</p>
<p>我仍记得在他失踪第二天的时候，我就已经想到他大抵不在这个世界了</p>
<p>在真正得知死亡的消息的那一天，当时的我也是对这个事实很平静地接受了，依然准备下一场面试，只不过在地铁上的我精神恍惚</p>
<p>事情已经过去半年，我经常在入睡前想到这件事，随着时间的推移，我以为这件事最终会过去，就好像看dnf的视频不会再轻易的想起他，看英雄联盟的视频不会再轻易的想起他，看到他推荐的up主发的视频不会再想起他，</p>
<p>事实也确实如此，从一开始每天都会莫名的想到他，频率逐渐变少</p>
<p>但事实上，你再也看到他在群里发消息了肆无忌惮的开玩笑了，再也不能从语音中听到他的声音了，再也没有人陪你双排峡谷和云顶了，再也没有人愿意和你尝试除dnf以外的mmo了,你永远地失去了这个朋友</p>
<p>但是这样的朋友以后不会再有了，仔细一下，和他在一起的时候是最近十年了最快乐的时光</p>
