<h2 id="lesson-1-a-puma-at-large-逃遁的美洲狮">Lesson 1 A puma at large 逃遁的美洲狮</h2>
<p>Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw &lsquo;a large cat&rsquo; only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed （confirmed跟了一个宾语从句）that a puma will （宾语从句这里用will 因为这句话是一个客观事实）not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved （prove是系动词 ）difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of &ldquo;cat-like noises&rsquo; at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been （ must have been 不是虚拟语气 表示推测）in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.</p>

<p><strong>Notes on the text 课文注释</strong></p>
<p>1 at large是介词短语，此处表示“逍遥自在”、“行动自由”的意思。
2 When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, 当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里的地方发现一头野生美洲狮时。这个从句中以that引导的从句是reports的同位语，用于进一步说明报告的内容。</p>
<p>However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>as the evidence began to accumulate,</p>
<p>, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p>这两句都是状语从句， claimed to have seen 不定式 to haven seen动作的发生比claimed 要早</p>
<p>在英语中，<strong>&ldquo;forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong> 这种表达方式中不需要加介词。这是因为“south of London”已经是一个方位短语，表示“在伦敦以南”的位置。“forty-five miles”则进一步修饰了这个方位，表示具体的距离。</p>
<p>所以，整个短语 <strong>&ldquo;forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong> 可以直接理解为“距离伦敦南方45英里处”，不需要额外的介词。</p>
<p>不过，如果你用介词，也可以，比如：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;at a location forty-five miles south of London&rdquo;</strong><br>
但这会使表达更冗长，通常不这样说。直接使用“forty-five miles south of London”更简洁和自然。</li>
</ul>
<p>这种结构在英语中很常见，例如：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;ten kilometers east of the city&rdquo;</strong> （在城市以东十公里处）</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;three blocks north of the station&rdquo;</strong> （在车站以北三个街区处）</li>
</ul>
<p>3 feel obliged to do sth. 是“感到不得不做某事”的意思。
4 it left behind it a trail of, 它身后留下一串……。 句末重心原则 原句应该是 left a trail ofxxx   behind it          svoo  宾语补语  behind it作<strong>补语</strong> a trail ofxxx is behind it
5 puma fur was found clinging to bushes中，clinging是现在分词， clinging to bushes此处作主语puma fur的主语补足语。下文中As no pumas had been reported missing…一句中，missing也是现在分词作主语补足语。</p>
<p>saw the puma up a tree.  up a tree. 是  puma  的补语</p>
<p>The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from</p>
<p>that the animal was a puma, 可以看做是状语从句  where had it come from，had是were now fully convinced过去的过去</p>
<p>6 in the possession of, 为……所有。</p>
<p>manage to do 表示成功地完成某件较为困难或具有挑战性的事情。这个短语通常用于强调某人克服了困难或障碍，最终达成了目标。</p>
<p><strong>参考译文</strong></p>
<p>美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。</p>
<p>pumas are large,cat-like animasl.which are found in america.when the report  came into london zoo that a puma had been spotted froty-five miles  south of london.  these reports were not taken seriously. howerver,as the  evidence began to accumlate,.the expert  from zoo felt obliged to investigate,for the discription given  by people who claimed to have seeen the puma were extraordinarily similar.</p>
<p><strong>搜寻</strong>美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时的看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它<strong>走</strong>哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿及死兔子之类的小动物，在许多地方看见爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮<strong>毛</strong>。有人抱怨说夜里听见“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏豢养的，不知怎么<strong>设法</strong>逃出来了。搜寻工作<strong>进行</strong>了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人<strong>担心</strong>。</p>
<p>the hunt for pumas began in a small village  where a women picking blackberries saw a large cat  only 5 yards away from her.</p>

<p>Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed （to get enough money )(to have the church clock repaired状语). The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.</p>
<p>One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o&rsquo;clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever are you doing up here Bill?&rsquo; asked the vicar in surprise.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to repair the bell,&rsquo; answered Bill. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.&rsquo;
&lsquo;You certainly did give me a surprise!&rsquo; said the vicar. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I&rsquo;m glad the bell is working again.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s the trouble, vicar,&rsquo; answered Bill. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s working all right, but I&rsquo;m afraid that at one o&rsquo;clock it will strike thirteen times and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.&rdquo;
We&rsquo;ll get used to that, Bill,&rsquo; said the vicar. &ldquo;Thirteen is not as good as one, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing. Now let&rsquo;s go downstairs and have a cup of tea.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 id="lesson-3-an-unknown-goddess-无名女神">Lesson 3 An unknown goddess 无名女神</h2>
<p>Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys high, were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.</p>
<p>The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess <strong>and had, at one time, been painted.</strong></p>
<p>The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find(amazed  原因状语) that the goddess turned out to be(the goddess主语补语） a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.</p>
<p>She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.</p>

<p>These days, people who do manual work often receive far（far是副词） more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as &ldquo;white-collar workers&rsquo; for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. <strong>This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.</strong></p>
<p>When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf&rsquo;s wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money.

<p>1 People who work in offices are frequently referred to as‘white-collar workers’, 那些坐在办公室的人，往往被称为“白领工人”。 white-collar workers往往指脑力劳动者，而体力劳动者则被称为 blue-collar workers, 蓝领工人。

<p>Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president&rsquo;s palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: ‘Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president&rsquo;s palace. ’The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing（现在分词作后置定语） him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.</p>
<p>The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would(使用 &ldquo;would soon&rdquo; 是因为主句使用了过去时态) soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet（<strong>yet</strong>作副词，adv. 又） another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired.

<p>The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o&rsquo;clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.</p>
<p>The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller&rsquo;s. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.</p>

When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn&rsquo;t despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do)!

<p>A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing ￡ 3, 000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé&rsquo;s wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. ‘So long as there&rsquo;s something to identify, we will give people their money back, ’said a spokeswoman for the Bank. ‘Last year, we paid ￡ 1. 5m on 21, 000 claims. ’</p>

<p>The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2, 473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. <strong>Now that</strong> a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.</p>
<p>During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to-30°and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard&rsquo;s monastery.</p>

<p>圣伯纳德大山口连接着瑞士与意大利，海拔2，473米，是欧洲最高的山口。11世纪<strong>建造</strong>的著名的圣伯纳德修道院位于离山口1英里远的地方。<strong>几百年来</strong>，圣伯纳德修道院驯养的狗拯救了许多翻越这道山口的旅游者的生命。这些<strong>最先</strong>从亚洲<strong>引进</strong>的狗，待人友好，<strong>早在罗马时代</strong>就<strong>给</strong>人当看门狗了。如今<strong>由于</strong>在山里<strong>开挖</strong>了隧道，翻越山口已<strong>不那么</strong>危险了。但<strong>每年</strong>还要派狗到<strong>雪地</strong>里去帮助那些<strong>遇到困难</strong>的旅游者。尽管修通了隧道，但仍有<strong>一些</strong>人<strong>想</strong>冒险徒步跨越圣伯纳德山口。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-9-flying-cats-飞猫">Lesson 9 Flying cats 飞猫</h2>
<p>How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights?</p>
<p>Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and <strong>affectionate</strong> towards humans, but they <strong>lead</strong> mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become <strong>submissive</strong> like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect <strong>feline</strong> independence. Most cats remain <strong>suspicious</strong> of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is <strong>a good deal of</strong> truth in this idea. A cat&rsquo;s ability to survive falls is based on fact.</p>
<p>Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, <strong>yet</strong> only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is <strong>no shortage of</strong> tall buildings. There are plenty of <strong>high-rise</strong> <strong>windowsills</strong> to fall, from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 <strong>storeys</strong>, yet only <strong>suffered from</strong> a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained <strong>paratroopers</strong>, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they <strong>are likely to</strong> injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.</p>

<p>1 Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. 在这句话中有一个否定词 never和一个含有否定意义的动词 fail，这两个否定词就组成了双重否定，而双重否定往往用来表示肯定。这句话可以译成：“猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。”
2 be based on，在……基础之上。
3 have in common，有共同之处。
4 the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。“the +形容词或副词比较级…the +形容词或副词比较级”的结构常用来表示比较关系，往往可以译成“越……越……”。 be likely to是“很可能会”的意思。</p>
<p><strong>参考译文</strong></p>
<p>猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。它们可以<strong>对人</strong>友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。它们从不<strong>像</strong>狗和马一样变得那么顺从。<strong>结果是</strong>人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。<strong>在它们的一生中</strong>，大多数猫都<strong>对</strong>人存有戒心。最使我们<strong>感兴趣</strong>的一件事情就是一种<strong>通俗的信念</strong>——猫有九条命。显然，这种<strong>说法</strong>里面包含着许多真实性。猫在跌落时能够<strong>大难不死</strong>是有事实作为依据的。</p>

<p>What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?</p>
<p>The great ship, Titanic, <strong>sailed for</strong> New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1, 316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46, 000 ton Titanic was a <strong>colossal</strong> ship**. At that time**, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen <strong>watertight</strong> <strong>compartments</strong>. Even if two of these were <strong>flooded</strong>, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great <strong>liner</strong> will always be remembered, for she went down on her first <strong>voyage</strong> with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Four days after <strong>setting out</strong>, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned <strong>sharply</strong> to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, <strong>narrowly</strong> missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a <strong>slight</strong> <strong>trembling</strong> sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so <strong>faint</strong> that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his <strong>horror</strong> that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people <strong>plunged</strong> into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1, 500 lives were lost.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-11-not-guilty-无罪">Lesson 11 Not guilty 无罪</h2>
<p>What was the Customs Officer looking for?</p>
<p>Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.</p>
<p>‘Have you anything to declare? ’ he asked, looking me in the eye.
‘No, ’ I answered confidently.
‘Would you mind unlocking （mind 后面一般加动名词）this suitcase please? ’
‘Not at all, ’ I answered.</p>
<p>The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer&rsquo;s face light, up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.</p>
<p>‘Perfume, eh? ’ he asked sarcastically. ‘You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty. ’
‘But it isn&rsquo;t perfume, ’ I said. ‘It&rsquo;s hair gel. ’ Then I added with a smile, ‘It&rsquo;s a strange mixture I make myself. ’
As I expected, he did not believe me.
‘Try it!’I said encouragingly.</p>
<p>The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.</p>

<p>1 the Green Channel，绿色通道，指海关专供没有携带征税物品进关的旅客所走的通道。
2 hidden in his suitcase是过去分词短语作定语，修饰watches，它相当于一个定语从句：which were hidden in his suitcase.
3 looking me in the eye，直盯着我的眼睛，这是分词短语作状语，表示方式，修饰 asked。</p>

5 in a dreadful mess （或 in a mess），乱七八糟，混乱透了。
6 I saw the Officer&rsquo;s face light up．我看到那位官员的脸上露出了得意的神色。 在使用使役动词（如 &ldquo;make&rdquo;、&ldquo;let&rdquo;）或感官动词（如 &ldquo;see&rdquo;、&ldquo;hear&rdquo;、&ldquo;watch&rdquo;，看到你做了，那你已经做了，所以可以去掉to，to有将来的意思）时，后面的动词通常用原形。light up 是宾语补语</p>

<h2 id="lesson-12-life-on-a-desert-island-荒岛生活">Lesson 12 Life on a desert island 荒岛生活</h2>
<p>What was exceptional about the two men&rsquo;s stay on the desert island?</p>
<p>Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. <strong>The other side of the picture is quite the opposite</strong>. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.</p>
<p>Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. Theycaught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it ‘ate like kings’. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.</p>

<p>我们许多人对于荒岛生活<strong>有</strong>一种不切实际的想法。我们有时想像荒岛是阳光终日普照的天堂。在那里，生活简单又美好。成熟的水果从树上掉下来，人们根本无需劳动。<strong>另一种想法恰恰相反</strong>，认为荒岛生活很可怕，要么饿死，要么像鲁滨孙那样，天天盼船来，却总不见船影。也许，<strong>这两种想像都有可信之处</strong>。但很少有人能有机会去弄个究竟。</p>

<p>岛上几乎没有一棵树，也没有淡水，但这不算什么问题。他们用橡皮艇<strong>蓄积</strong>雨水。<strong>由于</strong>他们随身<strong>带</strong>了一支捕鱼枪，因此，吃饭不愁。他们天天捕捉龙虾和鱼，正如其中一位所<strong>说</strong>，吃得“像国王一样好”。5天后，一条油轮从那儿<strong>路过</strong>，搭救了他们。这二位不得不离开那个荒岛时，还真的感到<strong>遗憾</strong>呢！</p>

<p>How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?</p>

<p>He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.</p>

<p>he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.</p>
<p>George took off his jacket,</p>

1 with some children, 介词with此处作“对于”讲。
2 go a long way, 可以维持很久。
3 If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, 如果50便士的分币没有用来换糖果的话。exchange…for…作“以……换……”讲，注意英语中的便士有两种复数形式pence和pennies, 但用法不同。如：a fifty pence是指1个50便士的硬币，而fifty pennies是指50个1便士的硬币。
4 <strong>have found their way there,</strong> 其中there是指储蓄罐。find one&rsquo;s way在这里作“进入”讲，即放到“储蓄罐”里。
5 what is more, 更有甚者。是固定词组，此处用作插入语。</p>
<p>small gifts of money/ gifts of money 零花钱</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。爸爸妈妈<strong>当然</strong>经常<strong>给</strong>孩子零花钱，但是，叔舅婶姨也是孩子们额外收入来源。<strong>对于</strong>有些孩子来说，<strong>少量</strong>的钱可以<strong>花很长一段时间</strong>。如果50便士不拿来换糖吃，则可以放在<strong>储蓄罐里</strong>叮当响上好几月。但是能把储蓄罐<strong>装满</strong>的只有<strong>屈指可数</strong>的几个特别节俭的孩子。对大部分孩子来说，用50便士来买一大块好的巧克力，是算不了什么的。</p>

<p><strong>With</strong> some children, small sums <strong>go a long way</strong>.</p>
<p>If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets，they <strong>rattle</strong> for months inside <strong>money boxes</strong>.</p>
<p>Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.For <strong>most of them,</strong> fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.</p>
<p>我的外甥乔治有一个储蓄罐，但总是空空的。我给了不少50便士的硬币，但没有几个存到储蓄罐里。昨天，我给了他50便士让<strong>存</strong>起来，却拿这钱给自己买了50便士的麻烦。在他去糖果店的路上，50便士掉在地上，在人行道上跳了几下，掉进了<strong>阴沟</strong>里。乔治脱掉<strong>外套</strong>，卷起袖子，将右胳膊<strong>伸</strong>进了<strong>阴沟盖。<strong>但他</strong>摸了半天</strong>也没找到那50便士硬币，<strong>他的胳膊反倒退不出来了</strong>。这时在他周围上了许多人，一位女士在乔治胳膊上<strong>抹</strong>了肥皂，黄油，但乔治的胳膊仍然卡得紧紧的。有人打电话叫来消防队，两位消防队员使用了一种特殊的<strong>润滑剂</strong>才使乔治得以解脱。不过，此事并没使乔治过于伤心，因为糖果店老板娘听说了他遇到的麻烦后，<strong>赏</strong>给他一大<strong>盒</strong>巧克力。</p>
<p>My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.</p>
<p><strong>Very few of</strong> the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have <strong>found their way there.</strong></p>
<p>I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.</p>
<p>Instead, he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.</p>
<p>On his way to the sweet shop,he dropped his fifty pence and it <strong>bounced</strong> along the pavement and then disappeared <strong>down a drain</strong>.</p>
<p>George <strong>took off</strong> his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.</p>
<p>He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, <strong>and what is more</strong>, he could not get his arm out.</p>
<p>A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,but George was firmly stuck.</p>
<p>The <strong>fire brigade</strong> was called and two fire fighters <strong>freed</strong> George using a special type of <strong>grease</strong>.</p>
<p>George was not too upset by his experience，because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large <strong>box</strong> of chocolates.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-16-mary-had-a-little-lamb">Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb</h2>
<p>Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour? Why not?</p>
<p>Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.</p>
<p>One of Mary&rsquo;s prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.</p>
<p>She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening.</p>

<p>Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb.</p>
<p>Dimitri immediately went to Aleko&rsquo;s house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.</p>

<p>Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard.</p>
<p>It was true that he had just bought a lamb he explained,</p>

Notes on the text课文注释</strong>
1 it would not prove difficult, 是不难做到的。
prove是连系动词，作“证明是”讲，本句子与it would not be difficult相同。
2 accuse sb. of (doing) sth. 作“指责、指控某人做某事”解。
3 he had better return it, 他最好把羔羊还给迪米特里。
had better用来表达一种建议，建议在将来某一具体场合采取的动作。这个短语比should和ought to的语气更强烈，常带有威胁、告诫或催促的意思。
4 denied taking it…,
deny后面可接动名词作宾语，也可接宾语从句。
5 apologize to sb. for (doing)sth. , 是“因（做）某事向某人道歉”的意思。</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>玛丽与丈夫迪米特里住在希腊南部一个叫波拉考拉的小村庄里。玛丽最珍贵的财产之一就是丈夫送给她的一只白色小羔羊。<strong>白天</strong>，玛丽把羔羊拴在地里的一颗树上，每天晚上把它牵回家。可是，一天晚上，那只小羔羊失踪了。绳子被人割断，很明显小羔羊是被人偷走了。</p>

<p>迪米特里从地里回来，妻子把情况跟他一说，他马上出去找偷羔羊的人。他知道在这样一个小村庄里抓住小偷并不困难。把失窃的事告诉几个朋友后，迪米特里发出他的邻居阿列科家突然<strong>多</strong>了一只小羔羊。迪米特里立刻去了阿列科家，气呼呼地指责他偷了羔羊，告诉他最好把羊交还，否则就去叫警察。阿列科不承认，并把迪米特里领进院子。<strong>不错</strong>，他的确刚买了一只羔羊，阿列科解释说，但他的羔羊是黑色的。迪米特里为自己的鲁莽而感到不好意思，向阿列科道了歉，说是错怪了他。就在他俩说话的时候，天下起了雨，迪米特里便呆在阿列科家里<strong>避雨</strong>，一直等到雨停为止。半小时后，当他从屋里出来时，他惊奇地发现小黑羔羊全身几乎都变成白色。原来羊毛上染的黑色被雨水冲掉了！</p>

<h2 id="lesson-17-the-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world">Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world</h2>
<p>The longest suspension bridge in the world</p>
<p>How is the bridge supported?</p>
<p>Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known,sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.</p>
<p>He described it as &lsquo;a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal,for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.</p>
<p>The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island.</p>
<p>It has a span of 4, 260 feet.</p>
<p>The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth <strong>had to be taken into account</strong> by its designer.</p>
<p>Two great towers support four huge cables.</p>
<p>The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.</p>
<p>These alone took sixteen months to build.</p>
<p>Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.</p>
<p>They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.</p>
<p>Each of the four cables contains 26, 108 lengths of wire.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars,</p>
<p>it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity.</p>
<p>However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.</p>
<p>Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant,</p>
<p>fulfilling its designer&rsquo;s dream to creat &lsquo;an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible&rsquo;.</p>

<p>1524年，一位<strong>鲜为人知</strong>的意大利人维拉萨诺驾船驶进纽约港，并将该港名为安古拉姆。他对该港作了这样的描述：&ldquo;地理位置十分适宜，位于两座小山的中间，一条大河从中间流过&rdquo;。虽然维拉萨诺绝对<strong>算</strong>不上一个伟大的探险家，<strong>但他的名字将流芳百世</strong>，因为1964年11月21日建成的一座世界上最长的吊桥是以他的名字命名。</p>

<p>维拉萨诺大桥由奥斯马.阿曼设计，<strong>连结</strong>着布鲁克林与斯塔顿岛，桥长4,260英尺。由于桥身太长，设计者不得不考虑了地表的形状。两座巨塔支撑着4根<strong>粗大</strong>的钢缆。塔身建在巨大的水下钢盘混凝土平台上。平台<strong>深入海底</strong>100英尺。仅这两座塔就花了16个月才建成。塔身 <strong>高</strong> 出水面将<strong>近</strong>700英尺。高塔支撑着钢缆，而钢缆又悬吊着大桥，4根钢缆中的每根由26，108股钢绳组成。据估计，若桥上<strong>摆满</strong>了汽车，也只不过是桥的总<strong>承载力</strong>的1/3。然而，这座桥重要特点不仅是它的规模与强度。尽管此桥很大，<strong>但它的结构简单</strong>，<strong>造型</strong>优美，实现了设计者企图创造一个&rdquo;<strong>尽量</strong>用细<strong>线</strong>条勾画出一个庞然大物&quot;的梦想。</p>

in response(to)作“回答’、“响应”、“作出反应”讲。此处是“（展品）随风而动”的意思。
5 be familiar to…是“为……所熟悉”的意思。
6 Lined up against the wall, 靠墙排列着。
7 like traffic lights which have gone mad, 就像失去控制的红绿灯一样。
go mad作“发疯”、“发狂”讲。
8 on and off（亦作 off and on）作“断断续续地”、“有时”讲。
9 These peculiar forms not only seemed designed…，其中seemed是系动词，seemed designed 作用与were designed是一样的。</p>
<p>familiar to 和 familiar with 是两个相近的词组，都有“熟悉”的意思，但是他们用法却有很大的不同，今天我们一起来学习一下。</p>

<p>绑架者很少对动物感兴趣。最近，绑架者却<strong>盯上了</strong>埃莉诺.拉姆齐太太的猫。埃莉诺.拉姆齐太太是一个非常富有的老妇人，多年来，一直同她养的猫拉斯一起住在一所公寓里。拉斯特斯生活很有规律，傍晚常常出去溜达一会儿，并且总是在7点钟以前回来。可是，有一天晚上，它出去后再也没回来。拉姆齐太太<strong>急</strong>坏了，四处寻找，但没有找着。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-21-daniel-mendoza">Lesson 21 Daniel Mendoza</h2>
<p>How many unsuccessful attempts did Mendoza make before becoming Champion of all England?</p>
<p>Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>In those days, boxers fought with bare <strong>fists</strong> for prize money.</p>
<p>Because of this, they were known as &lsquo;prizefighters&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, boxing was very crude,</p>
<p>for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.</p>
<p>One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.</p>
<p>The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860,when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.</p>

<p>In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.</p>
<p>He was adored by rich and poor alike.</p>
<p>Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.</p>
<p>This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most <strong>eminent</strong> boxer in England.</p>
<p>He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.</p>
<p>In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.</p>
<p>The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only <strong>be settled</strong> by a fight.</p>
<p>A match was held at Stilton,where both men fought for an hour.</p>
<p>The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.</p>
<p>Mendoza met Humphries <strong>in the ring</strong> on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.</p>
<p>It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.</p>
<p>He earned enormous <strong>sums</strong> of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appearance.</p>
<p>Despite this, he was so <strong>extravagant</strong> that he was always in debt.</p>

<p>参考译文
两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。因此，他们<strong>被称作</strong>“职业拳击手”。不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。
拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他作出了重大贡献。<strong>是他把</strong>科学引进了这项运动。门多萨在的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他祟拜备至。</p>

<p>门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后<strong>一举成名。<strong>这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。<strong>事实上</strong>，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他</strong>反目为敌</strong>。两个人争吵不休**，显而易见**，只有较量一番才能解决问题。于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上<strong>较量</strong>，门多萨又输了一场。直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。他在被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。他因<strong>无力还债</strong>而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。</p>

<p>Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the gaoler?</p>
<p>Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night.</p>
<p>One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter.</p>
<p>Yet this is not always the case.</p>
<p>A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.</p>
<p>In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.</p>
<p>Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,he always insisted that it should be written out in full.</p>
<p>One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if,</p>
<p>after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.</p>
<p>The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.</p>
<p>Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.</p>
<p>He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat.</p>
<p>But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.</p>
<p>It was simply a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The gaoler <strong>looked on</strong> eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.</p>
<p>The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>squinting</strong> his eyes, he said: &lsquo;The light is <strong>dim</strong>. Read the letter to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.</p>
<p>Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,</p>
<p>the gaoler replied: &lsquo;The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. '</p>
<p>With this, he hurried off the stage.</p>
<p>Much to the aristocrat&rsquo;s amusement,the gaoler returned a few moments later</p>
<p>with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he <strong>proceeded</strong> to read to the prisoner.</p>

<p>有些<strong>剧目</strong>十分成功，以致连续上演好几年。**这样一来，**可怜的演员们可倒霉了。因为他们需要一夜连着一夜地重复同样的台词。人们以为，这些演员一定会把台词背得烂熟，绝不会临场结巴的，但情况却并不总是这样。</p>

<p><strong>Yet this is not always the case.</strong></p>
<p>有一位名演员曾在一出极为成功的剧目中扮演一个贵族角色，这个贵族已在巴士底狱被关押了20年。在最后一幕中，狱卒手持一封信上场，然后将信交给狱中那位贵族。尽管那个贵族每场戏都得念一遍那封信。但他还是坚持要求将信的全文写在信纸上。</p>
<p>A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.</p>
<p>In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,he always insisted that it should be written out in full.</p>
<p>一天晚上，狱卒决定与他的同事开一个玩笑，<strong>看看</strong>他反复演出这么多场之后，是否已将信的内容记熟了。大幕拉开，最后一幕戏开演，贵族独自一人坐在铁窗后阴暗的牢房里。这时狱卒<strong>上场</strong>，手里拿着那封珍贵的信。狱卒走进牢房，将信<strong>交</strong>给贵族。但这回狱卒给贵族的信没有像往常那样把全文写全，而是一张白纸。狱卒热切地观察着，<strong>急于</strong>想了解他的同事是否记熟了台词。贵族盯着纸看了几秒钟，然后，眼珠一转，说道：&ldquo;光线太暗，请给我读一下这封信。&ldquo;说完，他<strong>一下子</strong>把信递给狱卒。狱卒发现自己连一个字也记不住，于是便说：&ldquo;陛下，这儿光线的确太暗了，我得去眼镜拿来。&ldquo;他一边说着，一边匆匆下台。贵族感到非常好笑的是：一会儿工夫，狱卒重新登台，拿来一副眼镜以及平时使用的那封信，然后为那囚犯念了起来。</p>
<p>One night, the gaoler decided to <strong>play a joke on his colleague</strong> to find out if,after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.</p>
<p>The <strong>curtain</strong> went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.</p>
<p><strong>Just then,</strong> the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.</p>
<p>He entered the cell and <strong>presented</strong> the letter to the aristocrat.</p>
<p>But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.</p>
<p>It was simply a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.</p>
<p>The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then, squinting his eyes, he said: &lsquo;The light is dim. Read the letter to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.</p>
<p>Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,the gaoler replied: &lsquo;The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. '</p>
<p><strong>With this,</strong> he hurried off the stage.</p>

<p>在小说中，我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家庭，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密。英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况。惊人的秘密称作“柜中骷髅”。在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地。当读者到小说<strong>最后几页</strong>了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.</p>

<p>The terrible secret is called &lsquo;a skeleton in the cupboard&rsquo;.</p>

<p>这种事发生在小说中<strong>是无可非议的</strong>。尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密。连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道， 但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅。我所认识的唯一的在柜中<strong>藏</strong>骷嵝的人便是乔治.卡尔顿，他甚至引以为自豪。乔治年轻时<strong>学过医</strong>，然而，他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家。<strong>有一次</strong>，我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记。乔治把我<strong>领</strong>进客房，说这间很少使用。他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭。我将<strong>衬衫</strong>、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把<strong>随身带来的</strong>两套西服中的一套挂到大<strong>衣柜</strong>里去。我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下惊呆了。一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的。我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。这是比“骇人听闻的秘密”更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！但乔治却无动于衷。“噢，是它呀！<strong>他笑着说道</strong>，俨然在谈论一位老朋友。“那是塞巴斯蒂安。你忘了我以前是学医的了。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-25-the-cutty-sark">Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark</h2>
<p>What piece of bad luck prevented the Cutty Sark from winning the race?</p>
<p>One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.</p>
<p>She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.</p>
<p>She <strong>serves as an impressive reminder</strong> of the great ships of the past.</p>
<p>Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.</p>
<p>The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.</p>
<p>This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.</p>
<p>It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,</p>
<p>but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.</p>
<p>It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home,but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.</p>
<p>In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.</p>
<p>A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly,</p>
<p>this rudder would be torn away as well.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.</p>
<p>After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,</p>
<p>but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.</p>
<p>Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.</p>
<p>She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.</p>

也可写成 both of these ships或 both ships。
3 The first of the two ships to reach Java…，两艘船中首先到达爪哇的……。不定式短语 to reach Java此处作定语，修饰 first，中间被另一个修饰 first的介词短语 of the two ships所分开。
4 take the lead，领先。
lose one&rsquo;s lead，失去其领先地位。
5 There is no doubt that if she <strong>had not lost</strong> her rudder she <strong>would have won</strong> the race easily. 毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵，“卡蒂萨克”号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。这是一个<strong>虚拟语气</strong>的句子，是对过去的一种假设。</p>

<p>人们在格林威治仍可看到19世纪最有名的帆船之一&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号。它<strong>停</strong>在陆地上，每年接待成千上万的参观者。它给人们留下深刻的印象，使人们回忆起历史上的巨型帆船。在蒸汽船取代帆船之前，&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号<strong>之类的</strong>帆船被用来从中国运回茶叶，从澳大利亚运回羊毛。&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号是帆船制造史上建造的最快的一艘帆船。唯一可以与之一比高低的是&quot;塞姆皮雷&quot;号帆船。两船于1872年6月18日同时从上海启航驶往英国，途中<strong>展开了</strong>一场激烈的比赛。这场比赛<strong>持续了</strong>整整4个月，是这类比赛中的最后一次，它<strong>标志</strong>着帆船伟大传统的结束与一个新纪元的开始。</p>
<p>One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.</p>
<p>She <strong>stands on</strong> dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.</p>
<p>She serves as an impressive <strong>reminder</strong> of the great ships of the past.</p>
<p>Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing <strong>vessels</strong> like the Cutty Sark were used to <strong>carry</strong> tea from China and wool from Australia.</p>
<p>The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.</p>
<p>The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.</p>
<p>This race, which <strong>went on</strong> for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.</p>
<p>It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>比赛开始后，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&quot;号率先抵达爪哇岛。但在印度洋上，&ldquo;卡萨萨克&quot;号驶到了前面。看来，它首先<strong>返抵</strong>英国是<strong>确信无疑</strong>的了，但它却在比赛中连遭厄运。8月份&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号遭到一场特大风暴的袭击，失去了一只舵。船身<strong>左右摇晃</strong>，无法操纵。船员用<strong>备用的</strong>木板在船上赶制了一只<strong>应急用的</strong>舵，并<strong>克服重重困难</strong>将舵<strong>安装</strong>就位，<strong>这样一来，<strong>大大</strong>降低</strong>了船的航速。因为船不能<strong>开</strong>得太快，否则就有危险，应急舵<strong>也</strong>会被<strong>刮走</strong>。<strong>因为这个缘故</strong>，&ldquo;卡蒂萨克&quot;号<strong>落到了后面</strong>。跨越赤道后，船长将船<strong>停靠</strong>在一个港口，在那儿换了一只舵。但此时，&ldquo;赛姆皮雷&quot;号早已在500多英里之遥了。尽管换装新舵时<strong>分秒必争</strong>，但&quot;卡蒂萨克&quot;号已经不可能取胜了，它抵达英国时比&quot;塞姆皮雷&quot;号晚了1个星期。但考虑到路上的多次<strong>耽搁</strong>，这个成绩也已很不容易了。毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵， &ldquo;卡帝萨克&quot;号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。</p>
<p>The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,</p>
<p>but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.</p>
<p>It seemed certain that she would be the first ship **home,**but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.</p>
<p>In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her <strong>rudder</strong> was <strong>torn away.</strong></p>
<p>The Cutty Sark <strong>rolled from side to side</strong> and it became impossible to <strong>steer</strong> her.</p>
<p>A temporary rudder was made on board from <strong>spare planks</strong> and it was <strong>fitted</strong> with great difficulty.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly,</p>
<p>this rudder would be torn away as well.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.</p>
<p>After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,</p>
<p>but <strong>by now</strong> the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.</p>
<p>Though the new rudder was fitted <strong>at tremendous speed,</strong> it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.</p>
<p>She arrived in England <strong>a week after the Thermopylae.</strong></p>
<p>Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.</p>

<p>No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements.</p>

<p>It seemed certain that this would win the prize.</p>
<p>But just before the competition closed,a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2, 400 pounds.</p>
<p>It had been baked by a college student who had used over 1, 000 pounds of flour, 800 pounds of sugar,</p>
<p>200 pounds of fat, and 400 pounds of various other ingredients.</p>
<p>It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.</p>

Notes on the text课文注释
1 No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements.
没有人能避免受广告的影响。
avoid一词需接动名词作宾语， being influenced是动名词一般式的被动形式。
2 Much as we may pride ourselves…，<strong>尽管我们可以自夸……，虽然我们可以为……而感到自豪。</strong>
这是一个让步状语从句，连词 much as可以译成“虽然很……”
3 get something for nothing，免费得到。
4 go wrong ，出差错，出毛病。
5 the response to this competition，对这一竞赛的反响</p>
<p>参考译文</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>没有人能避免受广告的影响。尽管我们可以<strong>自夸</strong>自己的鉴赏力如何<strong>敏锐</strong>，但我们已经无法独立自主地选购自己所需的东西了。这是因为广告在我们身上<strong>施加着一种潜移默化的影响</strong>。做广告的人<strong>在力图劝说</strong>我们买下这种产品或那种产品之前，已经仔细地研究了人的本性，并把人的弱点进行了分类。</p>
<p>Nobody can avoid being influenced by advertisements。</p>

<p>44</p>
<p>做广告的人们多年前就发现我们大家都喜欢免费得到东西。<strong>凡是用</strong>&ldquo;免费&quot;这个神奇的词开头的广告很少会失败的。目前，做广告的人不仅提供免费样品，而且还提供免费汽车，免费住房，免费周游世界。他们<strong>设计</strong>数以百计的竞赛，竞赛中有人可赢得巨额奖金。电台、电视使做广告的人可以用这种手段<strong>吸引</strong>成百万人的<strong>注意力</strong>。</p>
<p>Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong.</p>
<p>These days, advertisers not only offer free samples,but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.</p>
<p>They <strong>devise</strong> hundreds of competitions which will enable us to win huge sums of money.</p>
<p>Radio and television have made it possible for advertisers to <strong>capture</strong> the attention of millions of people in this way.</p>
<p>有一次，在电台播放的节目里，一个生产饼干的公司<strong>请</strong>听众烘制饼干送到他们的工厂去。他们愿意以每磅10美元的价钱买下由听众烘制的最大的饼干。这次竞赛在听众中引<strong>起极其热烈的反响</strong>。<strong>不久</strong>，形状各异，大小不一的饼干<strong>陆续</strong>送到工厂。一位女士用手推车运来一个饼干，重达500磅左右。<strong>相隔不一会儿</strong>，一个男子也带来一个大饼干，那个饼干把汽车的行李箱挤得满满的。凡送来的饼干都仔细地称量。最重的一个达713磅，看来这个饼干获奖无疑了。但就在<strong>竞赛截止时间将到之际</strong>，一辆卡车驶进了工厂，运来了一个特大无比、重达2,400磅的饼干。它是由一个大学生烘制的，用去1,000多磅的面粉、800磅食糖、200磅动物脂肪及400磅其他各种原料。饼干份量太重了，用了一台起重机才把它从卡车上<strong>卸下</strong>。饼干公司不得不付出比他们预计多得多的钱，因为为买下那学生烘制的饼干他们支付了24,000美元。</p>

课文注释
1 in the light of，依据，按照。
2 in terms of，从……方面（说来），按照。
3 grudge paying 中，grudge作“吝惜”，“不愿”解，后面要接名词或动名词。
这句话中的this service 指上文 to save our lives。
4 The conditions of society are such that…
such此处为代词，作“这样”解，that所引起的从句，可视为同位语从句。
5 be free from…，作“不受……影响”解，后面常接 pain（痛苦）， trouble（苦恼）， danger（危险）一类的词语。
6 By having to sleep in the open，由于不得不在露天过夜，这一介词短语作原因状语。
7 in times of real need，确实需要的时侯。
8 put them in the same class as begars，把他们归为乞丐一类。 the same… as…，像……一样。</p>
<p>据说每个人都靠出售某种东西来维持生活。<strong>根据这种说法</strong>，教师靠卖知识为生，哲学家靠卖智慧为生，牧师靠卖精神安慰为生。虽然物质产品的价值可以用金钱来<strong>衡量</strong>，但要<strong>估算</strong>别人为我们为所提供的服务的价值却是极其困难的。有时，我们为了挽救生命，愿意付出我们所<strong>占有</strong>的一切。但就在外科大夫给我们提供了这种服务后，我们却可能为所支付的昂贵的费用而抱怨。社会上的情况就是如此，技术是必须付钱去买的，就像在商店里要花钱买商品一样。人人都有东西可以出售。</p>
<p>It has been said that everyone lives by selling something.</p>
<p>In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge,</p>
<p>philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort.</p>

<p>The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for <strong>at a shop.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyone has</strong> something to sell.</p>
<p>在这条普遍的规律前面，好像只有流浪汉是个例外，乞丐出售的几乎是他本人，以引起过路人的怜悯。但真正的流浪并不是乞丐。他们既不出售任何东西，也不需要从别人那儿得到任何东西，在追求独立自由的同时，他们并不牺牲为人的尊严。游浪汉可能会向你讨钱，但他从来不要你可怜他。他是故意在选择过那种生活的，<strong>并完全清楚</strong>以这种方式生活的后果。他可能从不知道下顿饭有无着落，但他不像有人那样被千万桩愁事所折磨。他几乎没有什么财产，这使他能够轻松自如地在各地奔波。由于被迫在露天睡觉，他比我们中许多人都离大自然近得多。为了生存，他可能会去打猎、乞讨，偶尔偷上一两回；确实需要的时候，他甚至可能干一点儿活，但他决不会牺牲自由。说起流浪汉，我们常常带有轻蔑并把他们与乞丐归为一类。但是，我们中有多少人能够坦率地说我们对流浪汉的简朴生活与无忧无虑的境况不感到有些羡慕呢？</p>

<h2 id="lesson-28--five-pounds-too-dear">Lesson 28  Five pounds too dear</h2>
<p>Why was even five pounds &rsquo;too dear&rsquo; ?</p>
<p>Small boats loaded with wares sped to the great liner as she was entering the harbour.</p>
<p>Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board</p>
<p>and the decks were soon covered with colourful rugs from Persia,</p>
<p>silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware.</p>
<p>It was difficult not to be tempted.</p>
<p>Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen,</p>
<p>but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.</p>
<p>I had no sooner got off the ship than I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.</p>
<p>I had no intention of buying one,</p>
<p>but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds.</p>
<p>Some of them were as big as marbles.</p>
<p>The man went to great lengths to prove that the diamonds were real.</p>
<p>As we were walking past a shop,</p>
<p>he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass.</p>
<p>It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.</p>
<p>The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.</p>
<p>I examined one of the pens closely.</p>
<p>It certainly looked genuine.</p>
<p>At the base of the gold cap, the words &lsquo;made in the U.S.A.&rsquo; had been neatly inscribed.</p>
<p>The man said that the penwas worth $50,</p>
<p>but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30.</p>
<p>I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $5.</p>
<p>Gesticulating wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous</p>
<p>but he eventually reduced the price to 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Shrugging my shoulders I began to walk away when,</p>
<p>a moment later, he ran after me and thrust the pen into my hands.</p>
<p>Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair, he readily accepted the $5 I gave him.</p>
<p>I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain&ndash;until I got back to the ship.</p>

<p>当一艘大型班船<strong>进港</strong>的时候，许多小船载着各种杂货快速向客轮驶来。大船还未下锚。小船上的人就纷纷爬上客轮。<strong>一会儿工夫</strong>，甲板上就摆满了色彩斑斓的波斯<strong>地毯</strong>。印度丝绸。铜咖啡壶以及手工制作的漂亮的银器。要想不为这些东西所动心是很困难的。船上许多游客开始同商贩讨价还价起来，但我打定主意上岸之前什么也不买。</p>
<p>Small boats loaded with ware sped to the great liner as she was <strong>entering</strong>  the <strong>harbour</strong>.</p>
<p>Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board</p>
<p>and the decks were soon <strong>covered with</strong> colourful <strong>rugs</strong> from Persia,, indian <strong>silk</strong>, <strong>copper</strong> coffer pots and  handmade silverware.</p>
<p>It was difficult not to be <strong>tempted</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen,, but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.</p>
<p>我刚下船，就被一个人截住，他向我兜售一枚钻石戒指。我根本不想买，但我不能掩饰这样一个事实：其钻石之大给我留下了深刻的印象。有的钻石像玻璃球<strong>那么大</strong>。那人<strong>竭力</strong>想证明那钻石是真货。我们<strong>路过</strong>一家商店时，他将一颗钻石使劲地往橱窗上一按，在玻璃上留下一道<strong>深痕</strong>。我花了半个多小时才摆脱了他的纠缠。</p>
<p>I had <strong>no sooner</strong> got off the ship <strong>than</strong> I was <strong>assailed</strong> by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.</p>
<p>I had no intention of buying one,</p>
<p>but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds.</p>
<p>Some of them were as big as <strong>marbles</strong>.</p>
<p>The man <strong>went to great lengths</strong> <strong>to prove</strong> that the diamonds were real.</p>
<p>As we were <strong>walking past</strong> a shop,he <strong>held</strong> a diamond firmly against the window and <strong>made a deep impression</strong> in the glass.</p>
<p>It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.</p>
<p>向我兜售的第二个人是卖名贵钢笔和手表的。我仔细察看了一枝钢笔，那看上去确实不假，金笔帽下方整齐地刻有&quot;美国制造&quot;字样。那人说那支笔值50英镑，作为特别优惠，他愿意让我出30英镑成交。<strong>我摇摇头</strong>，伸出5根手指表示我只愿出5镑钱。那人激动地打着手势，仿佛我的出价使他不能容忍。但他终于把价钱降到了10英镑。我耸耸肩膀<strong>掉头走开了</strong>。一会儿，他突然从后<strong>追了上来</strong>，把笔塞到我手里。虽然他<strong>绝望</strong>地举起双手，但他毫不迟疑地收下了我付给他的5镑钱。在回到船上之前，我一直为我的绝妙的讨价还价而洋洋得意。然而不管我如何摆弄，那枝漂亮的钢笔就是吸不进墨水来。直到今天，那枝笔连一个字也没写过！</p>
<p>The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.</p>
<p>I examined one of the pens <strong>closely</strong>.</p>
<p>It certainly looked genuine.</p>
<p>At the <strong>base</strong> of the gold cap, the words &lsquo;made in the U.S.A.&rsquo; had been <strong>neatly inscribed.</strong></p>
<p>The man said that the pen was worth $50,but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30.</p>
<p>I shook my head and <strong>held up</strong> five fingers indicating that I was <strong>willing</strong> to pay $5.</p>
<p><strong>Gesticulating wildly,</strong> the man <strong>acted</strong> as if he found my offer <strong>outrageous</strong>,but he eventually reduced the price to 10 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Shrugging my shoulders</strong> I <strong>began to walk away</strong> when,<strong>a moment later,</strong> he <strong>ran after me</strong> and thrust the pen into my hands.</p>
<p>Though he kept <strong>throwing up</strong> his arms <strong>in despair</strong>, he <strong>readily</strong> <strong>accepted</strong> the $5 I gave him.</p>
<p>I felt <strong>especially pleased</strong> with my wonderful bargain&ndash;until I got back to the ship.</p>
<p>No matter how hard I tried,it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and <strong>to this day i</strong>t has never written a single word!</p>

<h2 id="lesson-29-funny-or-not">Lesson 29 Funny or not?</h2>
<p>What is the <strong>basis</strong> of &lsquo;sick&rsquo; humour?</p>
<p>Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.</p>
<p>The sense of humour is <strong>mysteriously</strong> bound up with national <strong>characteristics</strong>.</p>
<p>A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke.</p>
<p>In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.</p>
<p>Most funny stories are based on comic situations.</p>
<p>In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal <strong>appeal</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter where you live,you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s early films.</p>
<p>However, a new type of humour, which <strong>stems</strong> largely from U.S., has recently <strong>come into fashion.</strong></p>
<p>It is called &lsquo;sick humour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Comedians <strong>base</strong> their jokes <strong>on</strong> tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents.</p>
<p>Many people find this sort of joke <strong>distasteful</strong>.</p>
<p>The following example of &lsquo;sick humour&rsquo; will enable you to <strong>judge for yourself.</strong></p>
<p>A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p>From the moment he arrived there,</p>
<p>he kept on <strong>pestering</strong> his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home.</p>
<p>He <strong>dreaded</strong> <strong>having</strong> to spend Christmas in hospital.</p>
<p>Though the doctor did his best, the patient&rsquo;s recovery was slow.</p>
<p>On Christmas day, the man still had his right leg in <strong>plaster</strong>.</p>
<p>He spent a <strong>miserable</strong> day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing.</p>
<p>The following day, however, the doctor <strong>consoled</strong> him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.</p>
<p>The man <strong>took heart</strong> and **sure enough,**on New Year&rsquo;s Eve he was able to <strong>hobble</strong> along to a party.</p>
<p>To <strong>compensate</strong> for his unpleasant experiences in hospital,the man drank a little more than was good for him.</p>
<p>In the process, he enjoyed himself <strong>thoroughly</strong> and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals.</p>
<p>He was still <strong>mumbling</strong> something about hospitals at the end of the party when he <strong>slipped</strong> on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.</p>

<p>大部分令人发笑的故事都是根据喜剧<strong>情节</strong>编写的。尽管民族不同，<strong>有些</strong>滑稽的情节却能产生普遍的效果。比如说，不管你生活在哪里，你看查理.卓别林的早期电影很难不发笑。然而，近来一种新式幽默<strong>流行了起来</strong>，这种幽默<strong>主要来自</strong>美国。它被叫作&quot;病态幽默&rdquo;。喜剧演员根据悲剧情节诸如暴死，重大事故等来编造笑话。许多人认为这种笑话是低级庸俗的。下面是个&quot;病态幽默&quot;的实例，你可据此自己作出判断。</p>

<p>圣诞节前几周，某人摔断了右腿被送进医院。<strong>从</strong>他进医院那一刻<strong>时</strong>，他就缠住医生，让医生告诉他什么时候能回家。他十分害怕在医院过圣诞。<strong>尽管医生竭力医治</strong>，但病人恢复缓慢。圣诞节那天，他的右<strong>腿还上着石膏</strong>，他在床上郁郁不乐地躺了一天，想着他错过的种种欢乐。然而，<strong>第二天</strong>，医生安慰他说，出院欢度新年的可能性还是很大的，那人听后<strong>振作了精神</strong>。<strong>果然</strong>，<strong>除夕</strong>时他可以一瘸一拐地去参加晚会了。为了补偿住院这一段不愉快的经历，那人喝得稍许多了一点。在晚会上他尽情娱乐，<strong>一再</strong>告诉大家他是多么讨厌医院。晚会结束时，他嘴里还在嘟哝着医院的事，突然踩到一块冰上滑倒了，摔断了左腿</p>

<h2 id="lesson-30-the-death-of-a-ghost">Lesson 30 The death of a ghost</h2>
<p>Why did the two brothers keep the secret?</p>
<p>For years, villagers believed that Endley farm was <strong>haunted</strong>.</p>
<p>The farm was owned by two brothers, Joe and Bob Cox.</p>
<p>They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long.</p>
<p>Every time a worker gave up his job, he told the same story.</p>
<p>Farm labourers said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Hay</strong> had been cut and <strong>cowsheds</strong> had been cleaned.</p>
<p>A farm worker, who <strong>stayed up all night,</strong> claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn in the moonlight.</p>
<p>In time, it became an accepted fact that the Cox brothers employed a <strong>conscientious</strong> ghost that did most of their work for them.</p>
<p>No one suspected that there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen.</p>
<p>This was indeed the case.</p>
<p>A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died.</p>
<p>Everyone went to the funeral, for the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; was none other than Eric Cox,a third brother who was supposed to have died as a young man.</p>
<p>After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.</p>
<p>Eric had been the eldest son of the family, very much older than his two brothers.</p>
<p>He had been <strong>obliged to</strong> join the army during the Second World War.</p>
<p>As he hated army life, he decided to <strong>desert</strong> his <strong>regiment</strong>.</p>
<p>When he learnt that he would be sent abroad,he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Fearing the authorities, Eric remained in hiding after the war as well.</p>
<p>His father told everybody that Eric had been killed <strong>in action.</strong></p>
<p>The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob.</p>
<p>They did not even tell their wives.</p>
<p>When their father died they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding.</p>
<p>All these years, Eric had lived as a <strong>recluse</strong>.</p>
<p>He used to sleep during the day and work at night,quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley.</p>
<p>When he died, however, his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.</p>

<p><strong>多年来</strong>，村民们一直认为恩得利农场在闹鬼。恩得利农场属于乔.考科斯和鲍勃.考科斯兄弟俩所有。他们雇了几个农工，但谁也不愿意在那儿长期工作下去。每次雇工辞职后都叙述着同样的故事。雇工们说，常常一早起来发现有人在夜里把活干了，干草已切好，牛棚也打扫干净了。有一个<strong>彻夜未眠</strong>的雇工还声称他看见一个人影在月光下<strong>收割</strong>庄稼**。随着时间的流逝**，考科斯兄弟雇了一个尽心尽责的鬼，他们家的活大部分都让鬼给干了，这件事成了公认的事实。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-31-a-lovable-eccentric">Lesson 31 A lovable eccentric</h2>
<p>True <strong>eccentrics</strong> never deliberately <strong>set out</strong> to draw attention to themselves.</p>
<p>They <strong>disregard</strong> social <strong>conventions</strong> without being <strong>conscious</strong> that they are doing anything extraordinary.</p>
<p>This <strong>invariably</strong> wins them the love and respect of others,</p>
<p>for they add colour to the <strong>dull(monotonous )</strong> routine of everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Up to the time of</strong> his death,Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town.</p>
<p>He was a <strong>shrewd</strong> and wealthy businessman,</p>
<p>but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life.</p>
<p>He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.</p>
<p>Dickie disliked <strong>snobs</strong> <strong>intensely</strong>.</p>
<p>Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, <strong>preferring</strong> always to go on foot.</p>
<p>Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella.</p>
<p>One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower.</p>
<p>He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife,</p>
<p>but he was in such a <strong>bedraggled</strong> condition that an assistant refused to serve him.</p>
<p>Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag.</p>
<p>As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter.</p>
<p>The assistant asked him to leave,</p>
<p>but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager.</p>
<p>Recognizing who the customer was,the manager was most apologetic and <strong>reprimanded</strong> the assistant severely.</p>
<p>When Dickie was given the watch, he presented the assistant with the cloth bag.</p>
<p>It contained $300 in pennies.</p>
<p>He insisted on the assistant&rsquo;s counting the money before he left&ndash;30, 000 pennies in all!</p>
<p>On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings.</p>
<p>This exhibition received a great deal of attention <strong>in the press,</strong></p>
<p>for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists,</p>
<p>they had in fact been painted by Dickie.</p>
<p>It took him four years to stage this <strong>elaborate</strong> joke simply to prove that <strong>critics</strong> do not always know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>真正古怪的人从不有意引人注意。他们不顾社会习俗，意识不到自己所作所为有什么特殊之处。他们总能赢得别人的喜爱与尊敬，因为他们给平淡单一的日常生活增添了色彩。
理查德.科尔森生前是我们镇上最有名望的人之一。他是个精明能干、有钱的商人，但镇上大部分人对他生活中的这一个方面几乎一无所知。大家都管他叫迪基。早在他去世前很久，他的古怪行为就成了传奇故事了。
迪基痛恨势利小人。尽管他有一辆豪华小轿车，但却很少使用，常常喜欢以步代车。即使大雨倾盆，他也总是拒绝带伞。一天，他遇上一场瓢泼大雨，淋得透湿。他走进一家高级商店，要为妻子买一块价值300英镑的手表。但店员见他浑身泥水的样子，竟不肯接待他。迪基二话没说就走了。一会儿，他带着一个大布口袋回到店里。布袋很沉，他重重地把布袋扔在柜台上。店员让迪基走开，他置之不理，并要求见经理。经理认出了这位顾客，表示了深深的歉意，还严厉地训斥了店员。店员为迪基拿出了那块手表，迪基把布口袋递给他，口袋里面装着300镑的便士。他坚持要店员点清那些硬币后他才离去。</p>
<p>还有一次，他邀请一些著名评论家来参观他私人收藏的现代画。这次展览引起报界广泛注意，因为这些画名义上是名家的作品，事实上是迪基自己画的。他花了4年时间策划这出精心设计的闹剧，只是想证明评论家们有时并不解他们所谈论的事情。</p>

<p>Dickie disliked snobs intensely.</p>
<p>Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, preferring always to go on foot.</p>
<p>Even when <strong>it was raining heavily</strong>, he refused to carry an umbrella.</p>
<p>One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower.</p>
<p>He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife,</p>
<p>but he was in such a bedraggled condition that an assistant refused to serve him.</p>
<p>Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag.</p>
<p>As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter.</p>
<p>The assistant asked him to leave,but Dickie <strong>paid no attention</strong> to him and requested to <strong>see the manager.</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing who the customer was,</p>
<p>the manager was most apologetic and <strong>reprimanded</strong> the assistant severely.</p>
<p>When Dickie was given the watch, he <strong>presented</strong> the assistant <strong>with</strong> the cloth bag.</p>
<p>It contained $300 in pennies.</p>
<p>He insisted on the assistant&rsquo;s counting the money before he left&ndash;30, 000 pennies in all!</p>
<p>还有一次，他邀请一些著名评论家来<strong>参观</strong>他私人收藏的现代画。这次展览<strong>引起报界广泛注意</strong>，因为这些画<strong>名义上</strong>是<strong>名家</strong>的作品，事实上是迪基自己画的。他花了4年时间策划这出精心设计的<strong>闹剧</strong>，只是想证明评论家们有时并不解他们所谈论的事情。</p>
<p>On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to <strong>see</strong> his private collection of modern paintings.</p>
<p>This exhibition <strong>received a great deal of attention</strong> in the press,</p>
<p>for though the pictures <strong>were supposed to be</strong> the work of famous artists  ,they had in fact been painted by Dickie.</p>
<p>It took him four years to stage this <strong>elaborate joke</strong> simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-32-a-lost-ship">Lesson 32 A lost ship</h2>
<p>Did the crew of the Elkor find what they were looking for? Why?</p>
<p>The salvage operation had been a complete failure.</p>
<p>The small ship, Elkor, which had been searching the Barents Sea <strong>for weeks</strong>, was on its way home.</p>
<p>A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship&rsquo;s captain instructing him to give up the search.</p>
<p>The captain knew that another attempt would be made later,</p>
<p>for the <strong>sunken</strong> ship he was trying to find had been carrying a precious <strong>cargo</strong> of gold bullion.</p>
<p>Despite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more.</p>
<p>The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board when a chest was raised from the bottom.</p>
<p>Though the crew were at first <strong>under the impression</strong> that the lost ship had been found,</p>
<p>the contents of the chest proved them wrong.</p>
<p>What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.</p>
<p>The chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding.</p>
<p>There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife.</p>
<p>The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to <strong>salvage</strong> as much as possible from the <strong>wreck</strong>.</p>
<p>Nothing of value was found,</p>
<p>but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest.</p>
<p>From a heavy gun that was raised,the captain realized that the ship must have been a <strong>cruiser</strong>.</p>
<p>In another chest which contained the <strong>belongings</strong> of a ship&rsquo;s officer,there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943.</p>
<p>The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.</p>
<p>The most valuable find of all was the ship&rsquo;s log book, parts of which it was still possible to read.</p>
<p><strong>From this</strong> the captain was able to <strong>piece</strong> together all the information <strong>that had come to light.</strong></p>
<p>The Karen had been sailing in a <strong>convoy</strong> to Russia when she was <strong>torpedoed</strong> by an enemy submarine.</p>
<p>This was later confirmed by a naval official at the Ministry of Defence after the Elkor had returned home.</p>
<p>All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.</p>

<p>打捞工作彻底失败了。小船&quot;埃尔科&quot;号在巴伦支海搜寻了几个星期之后，正在返航途中。返航前，该船船长收到了大陆发来的电报，指示他们放弃这次搜寻。船长知道日后还会再作尝试，因为他试图寻找的沉船上载有一批珍贵的金条。</p>

<p>尽管船长接了电报，他还是决定再试一试。他们用结实的网把海床搜索了一遍。当一只箱子从海底被打捞上来时，甲板上人们激动不已。船员们<strong>开始认为</strong>沉船找着了，但海底沉箱内的物品证明他们弄错了。事实上，他们发现的是另一艘沉没多年的船。</p>

<p>木箱内装有水手艾伦.菲尔丁的私人财物，其中有书箱、衣服、照片以及水手收到的妻子的来信。&ldquo;埃尔科&quot;号船长命令船员们尽量从沉船中打捞物品，但没发现什么值钱的东西，不过打捞出来的众多的物品还是引起了大家极大的兴趣。从捞起的一门大炮来看，船长认为那艘船一定是艘巡洋舰。另一只海底沉箱中装的是船上一位军官的财物，其中有一封写于1943年3月14日的信，但没有写完。从这封信中船长了解到沉船船名是&quot;卡伦&quot;号。打捞到的东西中最有价值的是船上的航海日志，其中有一部分仍然清晰可读。据此，船长可以将所有的那些已经搞清的材料拼凑起来。&ldquo;卡伦&quot;号当年在为其他船只护航驶往俄国的途中突然遭到敌方潜水艇鱼雷的袭击。这一说法在&quot;埃尔科&quot;号返航后得到的国防部一位海军官员的证实。那次打捞到的所有物品均被送往军事博物馆。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-33-a-day-to-remember">Lesson 33 A day to remember</h2>
<p>What <strong>incident</strong> began the series of traffic accidents?</p>
<p>We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control.</p>
<p>What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.</p>
<p>It is as if a single unimportant event <strong>set up</strong> a chain of reactions.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time.</p>
<p>The telephone rings and this marks the <strong>prelude</strong> to an <strong>unforeseen</strong> series of <strong>catastrophes</strong>.</p>
<p>While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table,</p>
<p>smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.</p>
<p>You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, <strong>crockery</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the meal gets <strong>burnt</strong>.</p>
<p>As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.</p>
<p>Things can go wrong on a big scale as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a <strong>suburb</strong> of Sydney.</p>
<p>During the rush hour one evening two cars <strong>collided</strong> and both drivers began to argue.</p>
<p>The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner.</p>
<p>She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car.</p>
<p>This made the driver following her <strong>brake</strong> hard.</p>
<p>His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.</p>
<p>As she was thrown forward,the cake <strong>went right</strong> through the <strong>windscreen</strong> and landed on the road.</p>
<p>Seeing a cake flying through the air, lorry driver who was <strong>drawing up</strong> alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden.</p>
<p>The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them <strong>slid off</strong> the back of the vehicle and on to the road.</p>
<p>This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind.</p>
<p>It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles.</p>
<p>Only two <strong>stray</strong> <strong>dogs</strong> benefited from all this <strong>confusion</strong>,</p>
<p>for they greedily <strong>devoured</strong> what was left of the cake.</p>

<p>我们大家都有过事事不顺心的日子。一天开始时，可能还不错，但突然间似乎一切都失去了控制。情况经常是这样的，许许多多的事情都偏偏赶在同一时刻出问题，好像是一件无关紧要的小事引起了一连串的连锁反应。假设你在做饭，同时又在照看孩子。这时电话铃响了。**它预示着一连串意想不到的灾难的来临。**就在你接电话时，孩子把桌布从桌子上扯下来，将家中最好的陶瓷餐具半数摔碎，同时也弄伤了他自己。你急急忙忙挂上电话，赶去照看孩子和餐具。这时，饭又烧糊了。好像这一切还不足以使你急得掉泪，你的丈夫接着回来了，事先没打招呼就带来3个客人吃饭。</p>

<p>就像许多人最近在悉尼郊区帕拉马塔发现的那样，有时乱子会闹得很大。一天傍晚交通最拥挤时，一辆汽车撞上前面一辆汽车，两个司机争吵起来。紧跟其后的一辆车上的司机碰巧是个初学者，她一惊之下突然把车停了下来。她这一停使得跟在后头的司机也来个急刹车。司机妻子正坐在他身边，手里托着块大蛋糕。她往前一冲，蛋糕从挡风玻璃飞了出去掉到马路上。此时，一辆卡车正好从后边开到那辆汽车边上，司机看见一块蛋糕从天而降，紧急刹车。卡车上装着空啤酒瓶。成百只瓶子顺势从卡车后面滑出车外落在马路上。这又引起一场唇枪舌剑的争吵。与此同时，后面的车辆排成了长龙，警察花了将近一个小时才使车辆又开起来。在这段时间里，卡车司机不得不清扫那几百只破瓶子。只有两只野狗从这一片混乱中得到好处，它们贪婪地吃掉了剩下的蛋糕。这就是事事不顺心的那么一天！</p>
<h2 id="lesson-34-a-happy-discovery">Lesson 34 A happy discovery</h2>
<p>Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people.</p>
<p>The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases</p>
<p>to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place.</p>
<p>But no one has to <strong>muster up</strong> <strong>courage</strong> to enter a less <strong>pretentious</strong> antique shop.</p>
<p>There is always hope that in its <strong>labyrinth</strong> of <strong>musty</strong>, dark, <strong>disordered</strong> rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of <strong>assorted</strong> junk that litter the floors.</p>
<p>No one discovers a rarity by chance.</p>
<p>A truly <strong>dedicated</strong> bargain hunter must have patience,</p>
<p>and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it.</p>
<p>To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer.</p>
<p>Like a scientist <strong>bent on</strong> making a discovery,</p>
<p>he must cherish the hope that one day he will be <strong>amply</strong> rewarded.</p>
<p>My old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person.</p>
<p>He has often described to me how he <strong>picked up</strong> a masterpiece for a mere $50.</p>
<p>One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood.</p>
<p>As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to <strong>interest</strong> him.</p>
<p>The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor.</p>
<p>The dealer told him that it had just come in,</p>
<p>but that he could not be bothered to open it.</p>
<p>Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open.</p>
<p>The contents were disappointing.</p>
<p>Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger,</p>
<p>the box was full of crockery, much of it broken.</p>
<p>Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box and suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case.</p>
<p>As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it.</p>
<p>Glancing at it briefly the dealer told him that it was worth $50.</p>
<p>Frank could hardly conceal his excitement,</p>
<p>for he knew that he had made a real discovery.</p>
<p>The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece</p>
<p>by Correggio and was worth hundreds and thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>古玩店对许多人来说有一种特殊的魅力。高档一点的古玩店为了防尘，把文物漂亮地陈列在玻璃柜子里，那里往往令人望而却步。而对不太装腔作势的古玩店，无论是谁都不用<strong>壮着胆子</strong>才敢往里进。人们还常常有希望在发霉、阴暗、杂乱无章、迷宫般的店堂里，从杂乱地摆放在地面上的、一堆堆各式各样的破烂货里找到一件稀世珍品。</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>无论是谁都不会一下子就发现一件珍品。一个到处找便宜的人必须具有耐心，而且最重要的是看到珍品时要有鉴别珍品的能力。要做到这一点，他至少要像古董商一样懂行。他必须像一个<strong>专心致志</strong>进行探索的科学家那样抱有这样的希望，即终有一天，他的努力会取得丰硕的成果。</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>我的老朋友弗兰克.哈利戴正是这样一个人。他多次向我详细讲他如何只花50英镑便买到一位名家的杰作。一个星期六的上午，弗兰克去了我家附近的一家古玩店。由于他从未去过那儿，结果他发现许多有趣的东西。上午很快过去了，弗兰克正准备离去，突然看见地板上放着一只体积很大的货箱。古董商告诉他那只货箱刚到不久，但他嫌麻烦不想把它打开。经弗兰克恳求，古董商才勉强把货箱撬开了。箱内东西令人失望。除了一柄式样别致、雕有花纹的匕首外，货箱内装满陶器，而且大部分都已破碎裂。弗兰克轻轻地把陶器拿出箱子，突然发现在箱底有一幅微型画，画面构图与纸条使他想起一幅他所熟悉的意大利画，于是他决定将画买了下来。古董商漫不经心看了一眼那幅画，告诉弗兰克那画值50英镑。弗兰克几乎无法掩饰自己兴奋的心情，因为他明白自己发现了一件珍品。那幅不大的画原来是柯勒乔的一幅未被发现的杰作，价值几十万英镑。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-35-justice-was-done">Lesson 35 Justice was done</h2>
<p>The word &lsquo;justice&rsquo; is given two different meanings in the text.</p>
<p>What is the <strong>distinction</strong> between them?</p>
<p>The word justice is usually <strong>associated</strong> with courts of law.</p>
<p>We might say that justice has been done when a man&rsquo;s innocence or guilt has been proved <strong>beyond doubt.</strong></p>
<p>Justice is part of the complex <strong>machinery</strong> of the law.</p>
<p>Those who seek it, undertake an <strong>arduous</strong> journey and can never be sure that they will find it.</p>
<p>Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.</p>
<p>There are rare instances when justice almost <strong>ceases</strong> to be an abstract concept.</p>
<p>Reward or punishment are <strong>meted out</strong> quite independent of human interference.</p>
<p><strong>At such times</strong>, justice acts like a living force.</p>
<p>When we use a phrase like <strong>&lsquo;it serves him right&rsquo;,</strong></p>
<p>we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act <strong>of its</strong> <strong>own accord.</strong></p>
<p>When a thief was caught on the <strong>premises</strong> of a large jewellery store one morning,</p>
<p>the shop assistants must have found it impossible to <strong>resist the temptation</strong> to say &lsquo;it serves him right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow <strong>chimneys</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Towards midday</strong>, a girl heard a <strong>muffled</strong> cry coming from behind one of the walls.</p>
<p>As the cry was repeated several times,she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade.</p>
<p>The cry had certainly come from one of the <strong>chimneys</strong>,but as there were so many of them, the firemen could not be certain which one it was.</p>
<p>They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man&rsquo;s cries.</p>
<p>After <strong>chipping</strong> <strong>through</strong> a wall which was eighteen inches thick,they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.</p>
<p>As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move,</p>
<p>but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.</p>
<p>The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged,</p>
<p>admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney.</p>
<p>He had been there for nearly ten hours.</p>
<p>Justice had been done even before the man <strong>was handed over</strong> to the police.</p>

<p>&ldquo;正义&quot;这个词常常是同法庭连在一起的。当某人被证据确凿地证明无罪的时候，我们也许会说正义得到了伸张。正义是复杂的法律机器组成部分。那些寻求正义的人走的是一条崎岖的道路，从来没有把握他们最终将到正义。法官无论如何聪明与有名，毕竟也是人，也会出差错的。</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>在个别情况下，正义不再是一种抽象概念。奖惩的实施是不受人意志支配的。在这种时候，正义像一种有生命的力量行使其职能。当我们说&quot;他罪有应得&quot;这句话的时候，我们部分承认了某种特定的环境使得正义自动地起了作用。</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>一天上午，当一个小偷在一家大型珠宝店里被人抓住的时候，店员一定会忍不住说：&ldquo;他罪有应得。&ldquo;那是一座老式的、经过改造的房子，店里有许多废置不用的大壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱。快到中午的时候，一个女售货员听见从一堵墙里传出一种闷声闷气的叫声。由于这种喊叫声重复了几次，她跑去报告经理，经理当即给消防队挂了电话。喊叫声肯定是从烟囱里传出来的，然而，因为烟囱太多，消防队员无法确定到底是哪一个。他们通过叫击烟囱倾叫声而确定传出声音的那个烟囱。他们凿透了18英寸厚的墙壁，发现有个人卡在烟囱里。由于烟囱太窄，那人无法动弹。消防队员在墙上挖了个大洞，才终于把他解救出来。那个看来满脸沮丧、浑身漆黑的家伙从烟囱里一出来，就承认头天夜里他企图到店里行窍，但让烟囱卡住了。他已经在烟囱里被困了将近10个小时。甚至在那人还没被送交给警察之前，正义就已得到了伸张。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-36-a-chance-in-a-million">Lesson 36 A chance in a million</h2>
<p>What was the chance in a million?</p>
<p>We are less credulous than we used to be.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion</p>
<p>by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences&ndash;most of them wildly improbable.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>and wickedly plotting to <strong>bring about the hero&rsquo;s downfall</strong>. And so on.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Modern readers would find such naive solutions totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>After they <strong>had gone on,</strong></p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman&rsquo;s close resemblance to her husband</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>and even suggested that he might be his brother.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Franz <strong>poured scorn</strong> on the idea,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Bussman was fully acquainted with this story,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Needless to say, the man&rsquo;s name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz&rsquo;s long-lost brother.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>When the brothers were reunited,</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Hans explained how it was that he was still alive.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>After having been wounded <strong>towards the end of the war,</strong></p>
<p>28</p>
<p>he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Hans returned to his family home,</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>but the house had been bombed</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid,</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.</p>

<p>我们不再像以往那样轻易相信别人了。在19世纪，小说家常在小说结尾处给读者准备一系列的巧合&ndash;大部分是牵强附会，极不可能的。当时的读者却愉快地接受这样一些事实，一个低贱的女佣实际上是主人公的母亲；主人公一位长期失散的兄弟，大家都以为死了，实际上一直活着，并且正在策划暗算主人公；如此等等，现代读者会觉得这种天真的结局完全无法接受。不过，在现实生活中，有时确实会出现一些巧合，这些巧合除了19世纪小说家外谁也不会相信。</p>

<p>当我是个孩子的时候，我祖父给我讲了一位德国出租汽车司机弗朗兹。巴斯曼如何找到了据信已在20年前死去的兄弟的事。一次，他与妻子徒步旅行。途中，停下来与一个工人交谈，接着他们继续往前走去。巴斯曼夫人说那工人与她丈夫相貌很像，甚至猜测他可能就是她丈夫的兄弟。弗朗兹对此不屑一顾，指出他兄弟已经在战争中阵亡了。尽管巴斯曼夫人熟知这个情况，但她仍然认为自己的想法仍有百万分之一的可能性。几天后，她派了一个男孩去问那人是否叫汉斯.巴斯曼。不出巴斯曼夫人所料，那人的名字真是汉斯.巴斯曼，他确实是弗朗兹失散多年的兄弟。兄弟俩团聚之时，汉斯说明了他活下来的经过，战争即将结束时，他负伤被送进医院，并与部队失去联系。医院遭到轰炸，汉斯步行回到了西德。与此同时，他所在部队被击溃，他的所有档案材料全部毁于战火。汉斯重返故里，但他的家已被炸毁，左邻右舍谁也不知原住户的下落，汉斯以为全家人都在空袭中遇难，于是便在距此50英里外的一座村子里定居下来，直至当日。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-37-the-westhaven-express">Lesson 37 The Westhaven Express</h2>
<p>What was the mistake the author made?</p>
<p>We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual.</p>
<p>After years of conditioning,</p>
<p>most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables.</p>
<p>Ships may be delayed by storms;</p>
<p>flights may be cancelled because of bad weather;</p>
<p>but trains must be on time.</p>
<p>Only an exceptionally heavy snow fall might temporarily <strong>dislocate</strong> railway services.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>The truth is that when mistakes occur,they are more likely to be ours than theirs.</p>
<p>After consulting my railway timetable,</p>
<p>I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven.</p>
<p>It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted a mere hour and seventeen minutes.</p>
<p>When I boarded the train,</p>
<p>I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well.</p>
<p>At the time, this did not <strong>strike me as odd.</strong></p>
<p>I reflected that there must be a great many people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service.</p>
<p>Neither was I surprised when the train stopped at Widley,</p>
<p>a tiny station a few miles along the line.</p>
<p>Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals.</p>
<p>But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder.</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour,</p>
<p>but barely chugging along at thirty.</p>
<p>One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance.</p>
<p>I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express,</p>
<p>but he had not even heard of it.</p>
<p>I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived.</p>
<p>Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven.</p>
<p>When he denied the train&rsquo;s existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable.</p>
<p>There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white.</p>
<p>Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again.</p>
<p>A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>It said: &lsquo;This service has been suspended.&rsquo;</p>

<p>我们已经习惯于相信火车总是准点的。经过多年的适应，大多数人对火车时刻表产生了一种不可动摇的信念。轮船船期可能因风暴而推延，飞机航班可能因恶劣天气而取消，唯有火车必然是准点的。只有非同寻常的大雪才可能暂时打乱铁路运行。因此，一旦铁路上真出了问题，人们便不加思索地责备铁路当局。事实上，差错很可能是我们自己，而不是铁路当局的。</p>

<p>我查看了列车时刻表，满意地了解到有一趟去威斯特海温的快车。这是趟直达车，旅途总共才需1小时17分钟。上车后，我不禁注意到许多当地人也上了车。一开始，我并不感到奇怪，我想除我之外，想利用快车之便的也一定大有人在。火车开出几英里即在一个小站威德里停了下来。对此，我不觉得奇怪，因为即便是特别快车也可能被信号拦住。但是，当火车一站接着一站往前蠕动时，我便产生了怀疑。我突然感到这趟快车并没以时速90英里的速度呼啸前进，而是卟哧卟哧地向前爬行，时速仅30英里。1小时17分过去了，走了还不到一半路程。我问一位乘客，这是不是开往威斯特海温的那趟快车，他说从未听说过有这么一趟快车。我决定到目的地就给铁路部门提意见。两小时后，我气呼呼地同威斯特海温站站长说起此事。他说根本没有这趟车。于是我借他本人的列车时刻表，我带着一种胜利者的调子告诉他那趟车白纸黑字。明明白白印在时刻表上。他迅速地扫视了一眼，让我再看一遍。一个小小的星形符号把我的目光引到了那页底部一个说明上。上面写着：&ldquo;此趟列车暂停运行。&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is the importance of the dots, lines, and symbols engraved on stone, bones and ivory?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMs are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Historians have long been puzzled by dots,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>which began about 35, 000 B.C. and ended about 10, 000 B.C.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>By correlating markings made in various parts of the world,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>historians have been able to read this difficult code.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20, 000 years earlier than has been supposed.</p>

<p>未来的历史学家在写我们这一段历史的时候会别具一格。对于逐渐积累起来的庞大材料，他们几乎不知道选取哪些好，而且，也不必完全依赖文字材料。电影、录像、光盘和光盘驱动器只是能为他们提供令人眼花缭乱的大量信息的几种手段。他们能够身临其境般地观看我们做事，倾听我们讲话。但是，历史学家企图重现遥远的过去可是一项艰巨的任务，他们必须根据现有的不充分的线索进行推理。即使看起来微不足道的遗物，也可能揭示人类早期历史的一些有趣的内容。</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>历史学家迄今认为日历是随农业的问世而出现的，因为当时人们面临着了解四季的实际需要，但近期科学研究发现，好像这种假设是不正确的。</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>长期以来，历史学家一直对雕刻在墙壁上、骨头上、古代长毛象的象牙上的点、线和形形色色的符号感到困惑不解。这些痕迹是游牧人留下的，他们生活在从公元前约35，000年到公元前10，000年的冰川期的末期，以狩猎、捕鱼为生。历史学家通过把世界各地留下的这种痕迹放在一起研究，终于弄懂了这种费解的代码。他们发现代码与昼夜更迭和月亮圆缺有关，事实上是一种最原始的日历。大家早就知道，画在墙上的狩猎图景并不是单纯的艺术表现形式，它们有着一定的含义，因为它们已接近古代人的文字形式。有时，这种图画与墙壁上的刻痕共存，它们之间可能有一定的联系。看来人类早就致力于探索四季变迁了，比人们想像的要早20,000年。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-39-nothing-to-worry-about">Lesson 39 Nothing to worry about</h2>
<p>3</p>
<p>What was the differnce between Bruce&rsquo;s behaviour and that of other people?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>He simply had no sense of danger at all.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps bushes.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>But there was worse to come. Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Even this had no effect.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!</p>

<p>穿越平原的道路高低不平，开车走了不远，路面愈加崎岖。我们想劝说布鲁斯把车开回我们出发的那个村庄去。尽管路面布满石头，坑坑洼洼，但布鲁斯却一点儿不慌乱。他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们前面再走不到20英里就是一个村庄。这并不是说布鲁斯总是低估困难，而是他压根儿没有一点儿危险感。他认为不管路面情况如何，车必须以最高速度前进。</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>我们在尘士飞扬的道路上颠簸，车子东拐西弯，以躲开那些大圆石。车轮搅起的石块锤击车身，发出不祥的锤击声。我们想念迟早会飞起一个石块把油箱砸开一个窟窿，或者把发动机砸坏。因此，我们不时地掉过头，怀疑车后是否留下了机油和汽油的痕迹。</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>突然大石块不见了，前面是一片平地，唯一的障碍只有一簇簇灌木丛。这使我们长长地松了口气。但是更糟糕的事情在等着我们，离我们不远处，出现一个大裂缝。我们再次央求布鲁斯小心，他这才把车停了下来。我们纷纷下车察看那个大裂缝，他却呆在车上。我们告诉他那个大裂缝长50码，宽2英尺，深4英尺。这也没有对他产生任何影响。布鲁斯挂上慢档，把两只前轮分别搁在裂缝的两边，顺着弯弯曲曲的裂缝，以发疯的速度向前开去。我们还未来得及担心后果，车已重新开上了平地。布鲁斯又看了一眼地图，告诉我们那座村庄离我们只有15英里了。下一个障碍是一片约半英里宽的浅水塘。布鲁斯向水塘冲去，但车开到水塘当中，嘎吱一声停住了。仪表盘一盏黄灯闪着刺眼的光芒，布鲁斯兴致勃勃地宣布发动机里没油了！</p>

<p>3</p>
<p>How did the policeman discover that the whole thing was a joke?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>It has never been explained why university students seem to enjoy practical jokes more than anyone else.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Inviting the fire brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>As soon as he had hung up,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>they were not to take him seriously.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The student hid in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by force.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, 4 more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>As the men refused to stop working,</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>He threatened to call the police.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Pretending to speak seriously,</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.</p>

<p>谁也弄不清为什么大学生好像比任何人都更喜欢恶作剧。大学生擅长一种特殊的恶作剧&ndash;戏弄人。请消防队来扑灭一场根本没有的大火是一种低级骗局，有自尊心的大学生决不会去做。大学生们常常做的是制造一种可笑的局面，使大家笑上一场，当然受害者是笑不出来的。</p>

<p>那个学生躲在附近一拱形的门廊里，在那儿可以看见、听到现场发生的一切。果然，警察来了，不礼貌地请工人离开此地；但其中一个工人粗鲁地回了几句。于是警察威胁要强行使他们离开。工人说，悉听尊便。警察去打电话叫人。一会儿工夫，又来了4个警察，规劝工人离开。由于工人拒绝停下手中的活，警察想夺风钻。两个工人奋力抗争，其中一个发了火，威胁说要去叫警察。警察听后讥讽地说，这大可不必，因为他俩已被逮捕了。其中一个工人装模作样地问道，在被带往警察局之前，是否可以打一个电话。警察同意了，陪他来到一个投币地电话前，当他看到那个工人真的是给警察挂电话，才恍然大悟，原来他们都成一场骗局的受害者。</p>
